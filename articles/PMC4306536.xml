In the present study, the mechanisms of T-cell activation and its consequences were addressed in an acute peritonitis model in mice. The response of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to sepsis induction was compared between OTII mice, characterized by ovalbumin-specific T-cell receptor&#x02013;transgenic T cells, and C57BL/6 controls (wild type [WT] mice). Because ovalbumin was absent during peritonitis, the OTII CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells could not be activated by canonical antigen recognition. In both OTII and WT control mice, CD4<sup>+</sup> T effector cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressed the activation marker CD69 early after sepsis onset. However, full activation with upregulation of CD25 and proliferation took place only in the presence of the antigen. Besides this, the fraction of Tregs was lower in OTII than that in WT mice. Sepsis mortality was increased in OTII mice. Our data show that, in sepsis, partial activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is induced by a T-cell receptor&#x02013;independent pathway, whereas full stimulation and proliferation require a specific antigen. Antigen-dependent T-cell effector functions as well as Treg activity may contribute to sepsis survival.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS/ABBREVIATIONS</title><kwd>Acute peritonitis</kwd><kwd>OTII</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd><kwd>regulatory T cell</kwd><kwd>T-cell receptor</kwd><kwd>AP&#x02014;acute peritonitis</kwd><kwd>CFSE&#x02014;carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester</kwd><kwd>CLP&#x02014;cecal ligation and puncture</kwd><kwd>CASP&#x02014;colon ascendens stent peritonitis</kwd><kwd>CTLA-4&#x02014;Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4</kwd><kwd>Foxp3&#x02014;Forkhead box P3</kwd><kwd>gMFI&#x02014;geometric mean of fluorescence intensity</kwd><kwd>MHCII&#x02014;major histocompatibility complex class II</kwd><kwd>OVA&#x02014;ovalbumin</kwd><kwd>Treg&#x02014;regulatory T cell</kwd><kwd>TCR&#x02014;T-cell receptor</kwd><kwd>Teff&#x02014;T effector cell</kwd><kwd>WT&#x02014;wild type</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>SDC</meta-name><meta-value>T</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Sepsis remains a leading cause of death in intensive care units worldwide (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), despite extensive research and improvements in intensive care therapy. Although lethality has decreased across the last years to currently 30% to 55%, depending on severity (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), sepsis incidence is increasing because of the aging of the population (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The Surviving Sepsis Campaign estimates that 18 million cases occur annually, with costs of approximately US$ 22,000 per patient (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>It was first assumed that an adaptive immune response would need at least 2 days to establish itself (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)&#x02014;too late to influence the hyperacute disease course in sepsis. Interest in the adaptive immune response was raised when it became apparent that, first, T cells show signs of activation within a few hours of sepsis onset in both humans and mice (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and, second, mainly lymphocytes undergo apoptosis within the first 24 h of the septic insult.</p><p>The mechanisms of T-cell activation in sepsis are insufficiently understood. There are at least two possibilities. First, T cells can be activated via their master switch, the T-cell receptor (TCR). This requires canonical recognition of an antigenic peptide in the context of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on antigen-presenting cells. Specific antigen recognition results in activation of approximately 1 out of 100,000 T cells, with subsequent differentiation and proliferation, leading to a highly specific adaptive immune response. Second, cytokines such as interleukin 12 (IL-12), IL-18, or type I interferons (IFNs), typically released by activated innate immune cells, have antigen-independent stimulating effects on T cells, which has been termed the &#x0201c;innate pathway&#x0201d; of T-cell activation (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Both processes could occur during sepsis because the systemic dissemination of the endogenous microbiota floods the immune system with a wealth of both antigens and innate stimuli.</p><p>Regarding T-cell function in sepsis, different observations have been reported. As indicated by the expression of Ki-67 in humans, T cells proliferate in response to activation early during sepsis (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Later in the disease course, however, the proliferation of T cells was impaired after <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28, which correlated with mortality in postoperative intra-abdominal infection (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The impaired proliferation was accompanied by reduced production of IL-2, IFN-&#x003b3;, and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) by T cells (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The early response of T cells was shown to directly link the adaptive and innate immune systems (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In mice, effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells produce significant amounts of IFN-&#x003b3; during the first 6 h after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), by which they directly regulate the function of neutrophils (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Early during sepsis, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells also upregulate proapoptotic Bim and downregulate antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and a large fraction of T cells goes into apoptosis (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This mainly affects naive CD62L<sup>hi</sup> CD44<sup>lo</sup> T cells (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), depleting potentially protective adaptive immune cells. In addition, regulatory mechanisms of T cells&#x02014;such as the expression of the negative costimulatory receptor Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4)&#x02014;are active in the course of sepsis (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The expression of CTLA-4 correlated with the amount of apoptotic cells (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Recent studies indicate that, during sepsis, some CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells enter a state of exhaustion, characterized by the increased expression of PD-1 (Programmed Cell Death 1), CTLA-4, and GRAIL (Gene Related to Anergy In Lymphocytes), which is accompanied by functional impairment, such as decreased production of effector cytokines, loss of proliferative capacity, as well as decreased cytotoxicity, which in the end results in apoptosis (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>All these factors may lead to profound suppression of the adaptive immune response during sepsis. In fact, Mohr et al. (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) reported that the generation of antigen-specific antibodies was strongly impaired when mice were primed several days after CLP. Interestingly, the adoptive transfer of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T and B cells did not restore the immune response, implying that not only T-cell intrinsic defects but also active suppression may play a role.</p><p>In view of this complex scenario, it is not surprising that discrepant results have been reported concerning the influence of T cells on sepsis survival. Prevention of T-cell apoptosis improved survival and bacterial clearance (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). A protective role of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the first 30 h of septic insult was also shown by Martignoni et al. (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). They induced sepsis by CLP in CD4-deficient mice and found increased mortality accompanied by increased bacteremia, as well as functional impairment of neutrophils (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, other groups did not find changes in survival rate, bacterial clearance, or inflammation after CD4 T-cell depletion (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>); in some cases, even a detrimental role of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was observed when studying CD4- and TCR-deficient mice after CLP (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). As indicated by a study by Kasten et al. (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are important for modulating the function of neutrophils during early sepsis. Moderately strong antigenic TCR engagement fostered bactericidal functions in neutrophils and improved animal survival, whereas a lack of and, in contrast, excessive activation were both detrimental, the latter being associated with hyperinflammation. The authors conclude that the role of T cells is contextual, depending on both the degree of T-cell activation and the severity of sepsis (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Unraveling the complexity of the host response to sepsis&#x02014;involving the interplay of multiple cell types, a plethora of small molecule mediators, and numerous signaling cascades&#x02014;requires the use of appropriate animal models. Within the past decade, different surgical approaches mimicking suture failure with subsequent intra-abdominal bacterial invasion have been explored because they best reflect the entire complexity of human sepsis (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The most commonly used model is CLP characterized by intraperitoneal abscess formation (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In contrast, colon ascendens stent peritonitis (CASP) is a model of diffuse peritonitis. Because the latter may lead to obstruction of the intestine (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and unpublished observation), we opted for a modification of CASP: the model of acute peritonitis (AP). As originally described by Barrera and colleagues (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), in AP, the stent is implanted into the wall of the cecum rather than the ascending colon as in CASP. A hyperinflammatory state is followed by a hypoinflammatory state similar to the situation in human sepsis (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and unpublished data).</p><p>To elucidate the mechanism of early CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell activation during sepsis, we further used transgenic OTII mice expressing a transgenic TCR, which is specific for an ovalbumin peptide (OVA<sub>323-339</sub>) in the context of MHC class II molecules (I-A b). In clonotypic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the TCR will only be engaged if OVA is applied <italic>in vivo</italic>. Without OVA, OTII CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can only be activated independent of the TCR. In addition, the influence of antigen-specific activation via the TCR on survival, bacterial load, and inflammatory response was determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animal experiments and ethics statement</title><p>Breeding pairs of OTII mice (B6.Cg-Tg(TcraTcrb)425Cbn/J) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories.

The animals were cohoused in a conventional temperature-controlled animal facility with a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle. All experiments involving animals were performed according to the German animal safety regulations and approved by the animal ethics committee of the local animal protection authority (Landesamt f&#x000fc;r Landwirtschaft, Lebensmittelsicherheit und Fischerei Mecklenburg-Vorpommern).

Acute peritonitis surgery was performed as described by the group of Barrera et al. (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In brief, an 18-gauge stent was inserted into the cecum opposite the ileocecal valve and fixed. A small amount of bowel contents was extruded through the stent to ensure proper intraluminal position. For fluid replacement, the mice received 0.5 mL 0.9% NaCl intraperitoneally.</p><p>Survival was monitored every 3 h for 72 h by an observer who was blinded to the applied treatments. In addition, sepsis severity and body temperature were monitored every 6 h for 72 h. Sepsis severity was determined via general appearance, breathing frequency, and spontaneous and provoked behavior. Scores for healthy (0) to severe alterations (3) for each parameter were summed up (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).

These mice express a transgenic TCR specific for an OVA peptide (OVA<sub>323&#x02013;339</sub>) in the context of MHCII (I-A b). As a consequence, in the clonotypic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the TCR will only be engaged during sepsis if OVA is applied <italic>in vivo</italic>. Without OVA, clonotypic T cells, which are the majority, can only be activated in a TCR-independent manner.</p><p>To determine the activation status of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during sepsis, we measured the expression of activation markers CD69, CD25, and CTLA-4 on CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> effector T cells (Teffs) and CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) in both OTII and WT mice 24 h after sepsis induction; untreated animals served as controls.</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs had higher basal levels of all activation markers than Teffs. The expression of the early activation marker CD69 was significantly increased on Teffs and Tregs in septic WT and OTII animals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, A and B), confirming previous results of our group (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and Kasten et al. (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This was true for the level of expression per cell indicated by the geometric mean of fluorescence intensity (gMFI) as well as for the percentage of CD69-positive cells (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 1, at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/SHK/A240">http://links.lww.com/SHK/A240</ext-link>). Regulatory T cells additionally increased the expression of CTLA-4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, C and D). Full activation of T cells further requires an increase in CD25 expression on Tregs and Teffs. This, however, took place only in WT mice, whereas, in OTII mice, CD25 expression remained unchanged on Tregs during sepsis and it even decreased on Teffs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, E and F), indicating incomplete activation of T cells in the absence of the antigen. On the other hand, the fact that WT CD4<sup>+</sup> Teffs and Tregs, which comprise a broad TCR repertoire, induced CD25 and were hence fully activated, implies that TCR-mediated canonical antigen recognition occurs during sepsis in WT animals.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Activation markers on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells early during sepsis.

In nonseptic mice that received transferred cells, the cognate antigen OVA was required to induce proliferation in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 2, at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/SHK/A241">http://links.lww.com/SHK/A241</ext-link>).

However, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that were stimulated with OVA 3 days after the septic insult showed impaired proliferation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, B &#x02013; D). Hence, in agreement with other reports, sepsis-induced alteration of the T-cell response takes place also in the AP model, albeit with delayed onset.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Early during sepsis, antigen-specific proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was amplified, although it was later attenuated.

In septic mice, transferred transgenic OTII T cells proliferated even more vigorously than in nonseptic animals, if the antigen OVA was applied during AP surgery. Later during the disease course, however, antigen-triggered T-cell proliferation was impaired. T-cell receptor engagement by antigen was clearly necessary for full activation and proliferation of the T cells in sepsis. In the absence of antigen, such as in septic OTII mice, the early activation marker CD69 was rapidly upregulated on both Teffs and Tregs; in addition, Tregs increased CTLA-4 expression. However, there was no induction of CD25 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells nor were the cells able to proliferate.</p><p>The findings of the present study support the model of T-cell readiness on infection, which was proposed by Jiang et al. (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) based on their observations in <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>&#x02013;infected mice: most T cells were induced to express CD69 regardless of their antigen specificity, probably via type I interferons or toll-like receptor engagement on T cells, whereas only antigen-specific T cells were fully activated to express CD25 and proliferate. Sepsis is characterized by the systemic release of large amounts of microbe-associated molecular patterns or MAMPs. This can explain the partial activation in most T cells because CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are known to upregulate CD69 in response to lipopolysaccharide, CpG, or poly I:C (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Nonetheless, in septic animals, T cells failed to upregulate CD25 or proliferate if they were not given an antigen-specific stimulus. Because only antigen-specific activation will save T cells from apoptosis (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), presumably T cells that are partially activated in the absence of antigen will be prone to cell death in sepsis, as it has been shown in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> infection (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). This would reconcile the regular observations of both T-cell activation and cell death in sepsis.</p><p>In contrast to our results using the AP model of sepsis, Unsinger et al. (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) did not observe proliferation of transferred CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in WT animals after CLP and concluded that T cells were not fully activated in response to sepsis. Compared with the present study, the experimenters transferred a much smaller number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which, in addition, had not been selected for antigen specificity, such that the antigen-triggered proliferation may have been missed because of limited sensitivity. In AP, antigen-specific activation of transferred OVA-specific T cells proceeded unimpaired and was clearly measurable after 3 days. Moreover, approximately 1% of transferred CD4<sup>+</sup> OTII T cells proliferated during sepsis even in the absence of OVA. Because, in Rag-sufficient OTII mice, about 20% of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells bear nonclonotypic specificities (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), we assume that the proliferating cells were recognizing microbial antigens. In a pilot study, we observed approximately 15% of splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to express Ki-67 as early as 24 h after AP, whereas, in OTII mice, only 7% were Ki-67<sup>+</sup> (unpublished data), indicating proliferation of WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells early during sepsis.</p><p>Other groups including Unsinger&#x02019;s have reported impairment of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell function in sepsis (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Corroborating these findings, in our hands, CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell function was impaired in the later course of sepsis. At sepsis onset, however, these cells could be fully activated in an antigen-dependent manner and proliferated even more vigorously than in nonseptic animals. This adjuvant effect of sepsis appears to contribute to an effective immune response and bacterial clearance. Gurung et al. (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) showed that naive apoptotic cells induce a state of tolerance, whereas activated apoptotic cells support robust proliferation of T cells. Hence, besides the microbe-associated molecular patterns derived from the invasive bacteria, cellular activation and cell damage may act as danger-associated molecular signals contributing to the observed adjuvant effect early in sepsis.</p><p>In summary, the presented data show that, early during sepsis, antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are fully activated and proliferate. In addition, nonspecific stimuli lead to preactivation of a broad mass of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, as indicated by the induction of CD69.</p><p>To study the impact of the antigen-specific activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells on sepsis outcome, we compared the survival of OTII and WT mice in AP. Corroborating the findings obtained by Kasten et al. (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) in CLP, the AP-induced mortality was increased in OTII mice. Initially, OTII and WT mice showed moderately but significantly higher disease severity; even more impressive, their recovery phase was significantly prolonged, and, from day 2 onward, more animals died. In CLP, Kasten et al. (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) observed more bacteria and more neutrophils in the peritoneum as well as increased systemic IL-6 concentrations in OTII mice compared with WT controls. They were able to rescue animals by antigenic T-cell stimulation, implying that antigen recognition by T cells was required for neutrophil function and efficient clearance of bacteria (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In the present study, using the AP model, the bacterial loads in different organs and the systemic cytokine concentrations 24 h after sepsis induction were 10- to 100-fold increased in OTII as compared with WT mice. This suggests that the inability to mount an antigen-specific T-cell response to the infectious agents impaired the ability to control bacterial dissemination, resulting in an increased and/or prolonged inflammatory response. It was shown before that mice exhibiting the highest cytokine levels are prone to die from sepsis (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), and OTII mice were less resilient to inflammation. In contrast to WT animals, not a single OTII mouse with very high cytokine serum concentrations survived.</p><p>Because Tregs are required for control of inflammation in infection (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), we investigated the Treg compartment. It is well documented that, during CLP, relative Treg numbers increase, whereas their absolute number remains unchanged (e.g., <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This is most likely caused by a relative resistance to apoptosis compared with Teffs (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Moreover, Tregs and Teffs were activated within the first 24 h after sepsis. In this study, we corroborated these findings in the AP sepsis model. Notably, in both nonseptic and septic OTII mice, the percentages of splenic Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs were reduced to about 50% of that of WT animals. For the development of natural Tregs, antigen recognition in the thymus is required (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In the absence of OVA, some Tregs still develop in Rag-sufficient OTII mice. They originate from nonclonotypic T-cell precursors harboring endogenous <italic>Tcrb</italic> and/or <italic>Tcra</italic> rearrangements (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Therefore, they are not OVA specific but recognize other antigens. However, their TCR repertoire is narrowed to about 50% of that of WT animals, reducing their ability to control experimental graft-versus-host disease (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In a similar manner, the reduced numbers and narrowed repertoire of natural Tregs in OTII mice may have impaired their function in AP. In sepsis, Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs develop enhanced suppressive properties (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). They are required for recovery and restitution of immune homeostasis after septic inflammation, as our group has previously demonstrated by Treg depletion (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, Tregs in sepsis may be a double-edged sword (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Besides their role in limiting inflammation and promoting recovery from sepsis, their strong activation may account for the immunosuppression observed in septic patients, a major problem in clinical settings (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). We are currently analyzing their specific role during the immune suppressive state observed later in the course of sepsis.</p><p>It is known that OTII mice have a 4-fold increase in the CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio with a strongly reduced CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell population in the periphery (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). This, however, is unlikely to explain the increased mortality in these mice because depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was beneficial in murine sepsis (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). It appears that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to progression of inflammation by contribution to neutrophil recruitment as well as intestinal and liver inflammation (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that there are several mutually nonexclusive explanations for the reduced survival of OTII mice in acute sepsis: first, impairment of antimicrobial functions of antigen-specific Teffs; second, the lack of sufficient Treg numbers to ensure restitution of immune homeostasis; and third, less likely, alterations in the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell population.</p><p>In summary, the present study demonstrates that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are activated differentially during early sepsis. The TCR-independent stimuli preactivate these cells that need TCR-specific stimuli to become fully activated and proliferate. Adjuvant effects at the beginning of sepsis enhanced the antigen-specific T-cell activation, whereas it was attenuated in the later course of the disease. The antigen-specific T cells appear to influence the outcome of sepsis in a highly contextual manner: rapid exertion of effector functions may contribute to bacterial clearance but can also drive hyperinflammation, whereas Treg activity is required for reconstitution of immune homeostasis but may carry the risk of prolonged immune suppression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary Material</title></caption><media mimetype="document" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="shk-43-192-s001.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1084" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="document" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="shk-43-192-s002.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1085" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="document" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="shk-43-192-s003.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1086" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="document" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="shk-43-192-s004.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1087" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors thank Susanne Neumeister for expert technical help and Sebastian Stentzel for inspiring discussions and for critical reading of the manuscript.
