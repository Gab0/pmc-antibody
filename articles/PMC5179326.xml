However the mechanisms involved in the regulation of CD4 T cells responses in the lungs are incompletely understood. Here we have investigated the mechanisms involved in the regulation of Th17 differentiation in the lungs in response to immunization with LPS as adjuvant. Our data shows that both Myd88 and TRIF are necessary for Th17 induction. This distinctive fate determination can be accounted for by the pattern of inflammatory cytokines induced by airway administration of LPS. We identified the production of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 by small macrophages and IL-23 by alveolar dendritic cells, favoring Th17 responses, and IL-10 repressing IFN-&#x003b3; production. Furthermore, we show that exogenous IL-1&#x003b2; can drastically alter Th1 responses driven by influenza and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection models and induce IL-17 production. Thus the precision of the lung immune responses to potential threats is orchestrated by the cytokine microenvironment, can be repolarized and targeted therapeutically by altering the cytokine milieu. These results indicate how the development of Th17 responses in the lung are regulated by the cytokines produced by lung dendritic cells and macrophages in response to intranasal immunization with LPS adjuvant.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The lung mucosa is a major site of interaction of the immune system with microbial pathogens and other environmental antigens capable of stimulating strong responses<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. In view of the necessity to maintain lung function during infection, immune responses tailored to maximize elimination of pathogens that avoid unnecessary immune-mediated inflammation and cell death would be highly desirable.

Although the stimulation of most toll-like receptors (TLR) triggers activation of Myd88 signaling pathway, TLR4 - which recognizes LPS - has the unique characteristic among TLRs to use both Myd88 and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-&#x003b2; (TRIF) while TLR3 &#x02013;which recognizes poly(I:C) - only uses TRIF<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Subsequently we have dissected the contribution of both Myd88 and TRIF pathways in the regulation of CD4 helper T cell polarization in response to airway immunization. We have analyzed the control of Th17 effector differentiation by cellular and cytokine responses to intranasal immunization using LPS as adjuvant in parallel with poly(I:C)-dependent Th1 differentiation. Furthermore, the analysis of the pattern of inflammatory cytokines produced locally in response to airway administration of LPS or poly(I:C) and the identification of their cellular origin provide insights into the mechanisms controlling CD4 Th17 cell responses induced in the airway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>CD4 T cell activation in response to intranasal immunization</title><p id="P8">To analyze the regulation of CD4 helper T cell differentiation in response to airway immunization, we have used a well-established adoptive transfer system: 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> TCR-transgenic CD4 T cells congenic for CD45.1 were transferred into CD45.2 recipients. The recipients were immunized the following day through the airway with antigen plus adjuvant.</p><p id="P9">Cells were isolated from the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node (Med LN), the popliteal lymph node (PLN) and the lungs at various times and stained with a mixture of antibodies specific for CD4, CD44, CD45.1 and CD45.2 to identify and characterize the transferred TCR transgenic CD4 T cells. Initial experiments utilized 5C.C7 TCR transgenic cells, specific for a pigeon cytochrome c (PCC) peptide. In a recent report using this model, we have shown that within 2 hours of intranasal immunization with LPS + PCC, the frequency of 5C.C7 cells in the blood diminished dramatically, followed at 18 hours by comparable diminution from the lung. Numbers of 5C.C7 cells remained constant in the Med LN over this period (data not shown)<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, transferred CD4 cells quickly increased expression of CD69 and lost CD62L expression in the Med LN following intranasal immunization; by 6h, 31% of the cells were CD69+ and by 12h, 97% were CD69<sup>hi</sup>; almost &#x000be; of the CD69<sup>hi</sup> cells were also CD62L<sup>lo</sup> at 12h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1a</xref>).

By 1.5 days after airway immunization, Med LN 5C.C7 cells had completely downregulated CD62L and Ly6C (data not shown); CD44 was fully upregulated. 71.8% of transferred cells were CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD45RB<sup>lo</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1b</xref>). 5C.C7 cells in the peripheral lymph nodes were only partially activated at this time. 24.3% were CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD45RB<sup>lo</sup>, only reaching full activation on day 5. Thus, the initial priming occurs mainly in the Med LN, but not in the lungs. As previously shown with comparable systems with bacterial infection, the expansion of PCC-specific T cells reached its maximum by day 7 and 8; their frequency diminished rapidly until day 10&#x02013;12, remaining relatively stable or diminishing more slowly thereafter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. 5C.C7 cells in Med LN, PLN and lung retained an activated/memory phenotype out to 60 days, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1b</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Use of LPS as an adjuvant in airway immunization leads to an exclusive IL-17-producing phenotype</title><p id="P10">Airway immunization with LPS plus PCC resulted in Med LN and lung 5C.C7 cells that failed to produce either IFN-&#x003b3; or IL-4 6h after <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation. 31% of lung and 13% of Med LN 5C.C7 cells from these mice produced IL-17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a&#x02013;c</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Labelling 5C.C7 T cells with CFSE prior transfer revealed that IL-17-producing cells had fully diluted their CFSE (data not shown). The cytokine-producing patterns of memory phenotype cells were similar to those of the &#x0201c;acutely&#x0201d;-primed cells. When these cells were analyzed 45 days later, the Med LN 5C.C7 CD4 T cells still retained 11.8% IL-17 producing capacity (data not shown).</p><p id="P11">In contrast to the unique IL-17-producing phenotype of airway/LPS primed 5C.C7 cells, single-dose subcutaneous immunization utilizing LPS as an adjuvant resulted in both IL-17 and IFN-&#x003b3;-producing PLN cells at 5 days. 22.1% of PLN 5C.C7 cells produced IFN-&#x003b3; while 26.7% produced IL-17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d&#x02013;e</xref>). Such &#x0201c;mixed&#x0201d; LPS-induced subcutaneous priming was also observed in cells in the Med LN of these mice, where 18.6% produced IFN-&#x003b3; and 17.9% produced IL-17.

To determine where the priming occurred, we have pre-treated the mice with FTY720 to inhibit DC and T cell migration from lymph nodes. The cells from subcutaneously immunized mice in the PLN still produced both IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 while cells in the Med LN exclusively produced IL-17, implying that when priming occurred in the Med LN with LPS as an adjuvant, the response was limited to the production of IL-17. This suggests that it is the locus of priming, not the site of introduction of antigen, that determines the outcome of LPS adjuvanted priming<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. This argument was further strengthened by transferring <italic>in vitro</italic>-primed Th1 or Th17 CD4 T cells into normal mice that were then challenged either intranasally or subcutaneously with antigen plus LPS, the transferred cells retained their initial cytokine-producing phenotype (data not shown).

Because most TLR-associated molecule knockouts are available on a C57BL/6 background, we used OT-II TCR transgenic CD4 T cells transferred into wild-type and various gene-deleted C57BL/6 recipients and assessed the types of responses induced by airway immunization with ovalbumin (OVA). Our initial hypothesis was that Myd88 would be driving the Th17 differentiation in response to LPS and TRIF would not be used. Not surprisingly, recipients that lacked TLR3 or the type I interferon receptor (TLR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients) failed to support differentiation of OT-II cells to the production of IFN-&#x003b3; nor did these cells acquire IL-17-producing capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a, b</xref>). As previously reported, this indicates that poly(I:C) mediates its effects through type I interferon production, as a result of TLR3-mediated signaling<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P14">Since LPS can use both the MyD88 and TRIF pathways, we tested the capacity of recipients deficient in one or the other for their response to airway immunization with OVA plus LPS.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c, d</xref>, in TRAM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients, intranasal immunization with LPS plus OVA led to neither IL-17 nor IFN-&#x003b3; production by the OT-II cells, suggesting that TRIF is critical to Th17 differentiation.

TGF-&#x003b2; production by dendritic cells in response to bacterial intranasal infection has been shown to participate in Th17 differentiation in the airway<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.

That is, with only modest inhibition of Th17 differentiation, neutralization of IL-10 allowed a Th1 response to occur, mimicking what is seen in subcutaneous immunization with antigen plus LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Similarly, a previous report showed that the rapid release of IL-10 following LPS intraperitoneal injection suppresses LPS-induced IFN-&#x003b3; release, while neutralization results in increased IFN-&#x003b3; levels<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">IL-12 treatment of mice immunized with PCC plus LPS led the responding T cells to develop an almost exclusive Th1 response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4e, f</xref>), implying that the presence of large amounts of IL-12 could both induce a Th1 response and suppress a Th17 response.

Administration of IL-10 inhibited this response but did not &#x0201c;rescue&#x0201d; the IL-17 response, arguing that IL-10 inhibited the IFN-&#x003b3; response but was not important for the induction of IL-17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6a, c</xref>). By contrast, administration of IL-1&#x003b2; to Myd88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice recipients of OT-II cells primed with OVA plus LPS, while not diminishing the IFN-&#x003b3;-response, resulted in a robust IL-17 response.</p><p id="P27">Administration of IL-1&#x003b2; to a TRAM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipient also allowed the transferred OT-II cells to produce IL-17 in response to OVA plus LPS, implying that it is the deficiency of IL-1&#x003b2; in both Myd88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and TRAM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that prevents a Th17 response in such recipients of OT-II cells and thus implying that both the Myd88 and TRIF pathways are needed for an LPS-induced IL-1&#x003b2; production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6b, c</xref>). Finally, the failure of TRAM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients of OT-II cells to make an IFN-&#x003b3; response can be overcome by administration of IL-12. This is consistent with failure of IL-12 production in both the wild-type and TRAM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, presumably accounted for by the robust production of IL-10 in both animals.</p><p id="P28">Thus, inhibition of IFN-&#x003b3;-production in wild-type mice immunized through the airway with antigen plus LPS can be attributed to Myd88-dependent IL-10 production and the failure of IL-12 production, presumably as a consequence, while the production of IL-17 by T cells in such animals can be attributed to Myd88- and TRAM-dependent IL-1&#x003b2; production.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>IL-1&#x003b2; induces a Th17 response in the course of an <italic>influenza</italic> infection</title><p id="P29">Based on all the results, we theorize that fine-tuning the cytokine microenvironment in the lungs can dramatically alter the choice of helper T cell differentiation. Using a live infection that induces a Th1 response in the airway, we have assessed whether providing IL-1&#x003b2; during an infection that strongly induces a CD4 IFN-&#x003b3; response would also polarize to a Th17 response. We studied priming of CD4 T cells in mice that were infected intranasally with the non-lethal <italic>influenza</italic> strain H1N1 virus Tx91<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a,b</xref>, endogenous lung CD4 T cells made a response to <italic>influenza</italic> dominated by the capacity of CD4 T cells to produce IFN-&#x003b3;. The addition of IL-1&#x003b2; increased the proportion of IL-17 producers in the lung but did not affect IFN-&#x003b3;-producing cells; only a modest proportion of the IFN-&#x003b3;-producers also produced IL-17. No increase in IL-17 producers was observed in the Med LN. During rheumatoid arthritis, IL-23p19 and IL-6 expression can be induced by IL-1&#x003b2; via NF-&#x003ba;B, suggesting that the addition of IL-1&#x003b2; during influenza can induce IL-23p19 and IL-6 in a similar fashion<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P30">In addition, we analyzed the lung immunopathological consequences of providing IL-1&#x003b2; during influenza infection: immunohistochemistry analysis of lung sections shows excessive peri alveolar and transmural inflammatory cell infiltrates, and goblet cells metaplasia when IL-1&#x003b2; is added during Tx91 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S5</xref>). Similar excessive immunopathology is observed in mice infected with influenza and treated with E. coli LT-IIb<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. An even more striking IL-1&#x003b2;-mediated induction of endogenous CD4 T cells to adopt a Th17 phenotype occurred in mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>), with the frequency of IL-17-producers in the lung increasing from 10% to 37%.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S12"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P31">Our results suggest that in response to intranasal immunization using LPS as adjuvant: Myd88-dependent IL-1&#x003b2; production by lung macrophages and the expression of TRIF are required for Th17 differentiation, and that Myd88-dependent IL-10 production is required for Th1 inhibition. Although our data support recent reports that intranasal infection by bacteria induces a Th17 response<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, its molecular regulation at the cellular and cytokine levels remain unclear. Here, we have explored the regulation of Th17 airway responses and have shown that the distinctive pattern of inflammatory cytokines produced in response to the two adjuvants LPS and poly(I:C), can account for the highly polarized CD4 T cell responses elicited. We have systematically analyzed the regulation of Th17 differentiation, as a consequence of the Myd88/ TRIF signalling cascade in response to TLR ligands and subsequent regulation and cellular origin of the polarizing cytokines in the airway. New findings in this study provide a better understanding of the interconnection between adjuvants and polarizing cytokines during Th17 differentiation in the airway.</p><p id="P32">Subcutaneous immunization utilizing LPS as an adjuvant generally results in a CD4 T cell mixed response in the sense that cells capable of secreting IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-4 or IL-17 are induced to varying degrees<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. We and others have observed that the response to LPS or bacterial airway immunization is largely limited to cells that produced IL-17 upon <italic>in vitro</italic> challenge<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Nonetheless the distinctive Th17-only cytokine profile with intranasal immunization compared with the mixed response induced by a systemic immunization has not been explained. One can argue that great precision should be required of a response aimed at lung infections since in the lung, among all mucosal tissues, an inappropriate effector response is apt to be of the greatest consequence. For example, inappropriate mobilization of neutrophils in the case of a virus infection might lead to a marked reduction in airway function, at great cost to the individual, with little or no apparent immune benefit<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P33">In the present study, the analysis of cytokines in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid 18 hours after airway introduction of LPS showed substantial amounts of IL-6, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-10 and little to no IL-12. IL-1&#x003b2; pro-form and IL-6 were both detected in lung small macrophages while IL-23 was made by lung alveolar DC. A recent report showed that IL-6 and TGF-&#x003b2; production by dendritic cells is required for Th17 differentiation in the lungs. Our data show that neutralization of IL-1&#x003b2; markedly reduced the frequency of LPS-induced IL-17-producing cells without enhancing an IFN-&#x003b3; response, in keeping with the known effects of IL-1&#x003b2; in the development of Th17 cells<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we found that exogenous intranasal IL-1&#x003b2; can induce Th17 effector cells independently of the Th1 response induced by poly(I:C). We also show that neutralizing IL-10, while only moderately diminishing the Th17 response to LPS, resulted in the appearance of IFN-&#x003b3;-producing cells. This was associated with the appearance of IL-12 in the BAL, implying that IL-10 produced in response to LPS blocked the production of IL-12 and thus blocked the induction of a Th1 response. Indeed, administration of excess IL-12 in the airway of mice immunized with LPS adjuvant fully polarized the response to the Th1 phenotype.</p><p id="P34">The distinctive pattern of cytokines induced upon LPS treatment was shown to depend upon the signalling pathways activated by TLR4<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. A recent study showed that TRIF expression by lung dendritic cells induces a Th17 response associated with neutrophilic asthma<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Our LPS intranasal immunization model supports this and shows that when TRAM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice - in which the TLR4 TRIF pathway is disabled but the Myd88 pathway remains intact - were immunized, IL-1&#x003b2; production was blocked but IL-10 continued to be made, accounting for the lack of a Th17 and a Th1 response respectively<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Additionally, deletion of Myd88 had an even more dramatic effect since in its absence LPS failed to induce IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-10 and IL-12. Thus, the Th17 response to intranasal immunization with LPS required the expression of either TRIF or Myd88 and failed to occur presumably because of the absence of IL-1&#x003b2;. In its place, while IL-12 levels remained very low, in the absence of IL-10 a robust Th1 response occurred. This implies that in the airway, IL-1&#x003b2; production in response to LPS requires contributions from signalling through both the TRIF and Myd88 pathways and only if both pathways are intact does LPS act to promote a Th17 response by transferred OT-II cells. Indeed, it has been reported that in response to TLR4-dependent LPS signalling in DCs and macrophages, Myd88 is important in pro-IL-1&#x003b2; production while TRIF is needed for IL-1&#x003b2; maturation<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we show that in the absence of IL-10, LPS intranasal immunization can induce IFN-&#x003b3;, suggesting that just like in a subcutaneous immunization, LPS has the potency to induce IFN-&#x003b3;, but that this pathway is inhibited by the production of IL-10 in the airway.</p><p id="P35">The capacity of poly(I:C) to enhance a Th1 response can also be traced to the pattern of inflammatory cytokines induced in BAL. Thus, our data show that poly(I:C) induces IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-12 in BAL, and IFN&#x003b1; and IL-12 production by alveolar macrophages<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Also while blocking IL-12 in our model diminishes the Th1 response induced by poly(I:C), treating mice with IL-10 both blocks IL-12 production and prevents the Th1 differentiation<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. Interestingly two different cell types are mainly involved: whilst we show that alveolar macrophages are the major cell type producing Th1-polarizing cytokines, small macrophages are restricted to make Th17-inducing cytokines.</p><p id="P36">Although our analysis is based on an adoptive transfer model, it is consistent with our observations in two infectious systems. We used influenza or LCMV infections that induce highly polarized Th1 responses in the lung, consistent with the importance of IFN-&#x003b3; in controlling these infections<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Our data shows that instilling IL-1&#x003b2; in the airway in both settings strikingly induces a lung Th17 response arguing that such responses in the lung fine-tune CD4 T cell differentiation and that IL-1&#x003b2; remains the key to Th17 production in infectious settings just as it does in model systems. A previous report has shown significant increased mortality with IL-1R&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice during lethal H1N1 influenza infection, and suggested that although IL-1&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; may increase pulmonary inflammatory pathology, it enhances survival<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. Although the strain we used was not lethal, our data suggest that the IL-1&#x003b2;-induced Th17 response could be in part responsible for the increased survival and the acute pneumonia. Keeping in mind that neutrophilia is elevated in the majority of cases of COPD in patients; the excessive recruitment of neutrophils could largely outweight the benefit of the Th17 response. Furthermore, our results with mice infected with influenza and treated with IL-1&#x003b2; support another study where induction of IL-17 and IL-22, and increased bacterial clearance were seen in mice co-infected with influenza A H1N1 and Staphylococcus aureus when IL-23 is overexpressed<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. As combined influenza and bacterial pneumonia are among the most deadly infectious diseases, it is critical to understand the mechanisms of increased susceptibility to superinfection in the lung and subsequent coordinated cellular and cytokine responses to effectively control the infection.</p><p id="P37">Our results further suggest that airway vaccinations for resistance to lung pathogens need to use or select adjuvants to tailor the immune response and generate efficient protective immunity. We argue that CD4 T cell responses in the lung, perhaps more than in any other tissue, need to be regulated with exquisite precision if they are not to avoid to severe immunopathology perhaps coupled with poor protection. Ultimately, therapeutic targeting of key polarizing cytokines during the early steps of the immune response can reprogram the cytokine microenvironment in the airway and allow control of the inflammatory response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S13"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Mice</title><p id="P38">B10.A and B10.A.SJL-<italic>Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> -<italic>Ptprc<sup>a</sup></italic>-5C.C7(TcRa, TcRb) were obtained from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY).
