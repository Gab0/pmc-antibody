Recently, it has become clear that metabolic reprogramming plays a critical role in promoting T cell activation, differentiation, and function. Targeting metabolism can preferentially inhibit T cell effector generation while simultaneously promoting the generation of T regulatory cells. We hypothesized that costimulatory blockade with CTLA4Ig in combination with targeting T cell metabolism might provide a novel platform to promote the induction of transplant tolerance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>model</kwd><kwd>transplantation</kwd><kwd>immunology</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>costimulation blockade</kwd><kwd>rejection</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Institutes of Health<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">R01AI077610</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="52"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="7462"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transplantation is now recognized as the most effective therapy for patients with end stage organ failure. Despite outstanding short-term graft and patient survival, organ transplantation continues to face several major challenges including poor long-term graft survivadyl resulting from chronic rejection (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and major side effects from the need for long-term immunosuppressive therapy (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Along these lines, a long elusive goal of human organ transplantation has been the development of therapeutic prophylaxis to prevent graft rejection that ultimately induce transplant tolerance in the absence of long-term immunosuppression.</p><p>To this end, maintenance of immunosuppression and treatments for graft rejection rely heavily on the use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These regimens consist of truly potent immunosuppressive agents in that not only do they inhibit immune activation but they also inhibit the induction of tolerance (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Indeed T regulatory cell generation, activation induced cell death, and T cell anergy are all inhibited by calcineurin inhibitors (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). More recently, the use of costimulatory blockade has been employed in experimental and clinical transplant protocols. T cell activation require signals elicited by the T cell receptor (TCR), costimulatory receptors and the immune microenvironment (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). CD28 is expressed on the surface of the majority of na&#x000ef;ve CD4+ and CD8 T+ cells and is the major costimulatory molecule in initial T cell activation (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Targeting CD28/B7 T-cell co-stimulation pathways with CTLA4Ig to reduce pathological T-cell responses has met with therapeutic success in transplantation, but challenges remain (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Data from phase III clinical trials have shown promising results with significant improvement in risk of death, graft loss, donor-specific antibodies and better graft function with CTLA4Ig compared to CNIs (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). However, regimens with CTLA4Ig have also shown higher incidence and severity of acute rejection, especially during the early phase post-transplantation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Furthermore, while costimulatory blockade has been shown to promote tolerance in animal models of transplantation, such has not been achieved with these agents in human trials (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>It is becoming increasingly clear that immune cell activation, differentiation, and function is intimately linked to cellular metabolic reprogramming (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Similar to cancer cells, activated T cells markedly upregulate glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen. Simultaneously, metabolites generated through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) can be employed to generate the substrates (amino acids, lipids and nucleic acids) for the prodigious anabolic demands of activation. To this end, glutamine plays a critical role in promoting this process through its conversion to glutamate and subsequently alpha ketoglutarate (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). While these metabolic processes are critical for T cell effector function, na&#x000ef;ve T cells and regulatory T cells rely on more conventional metabolic programs such as oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation. With this in mind, we recently demonstrated the ability of anti-metabolic therapy to prevent graft rejection in mouse models of transplantation (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Using this approach we were able to maximally inhibit the expansion and function of antigen specific effector cells while promoting the generation of antigen specific regulatory T cells. Nonetheless, long term allograft survival in heart transplants required continued drug treatment. That is, while our metabolic therapy inhibited effector function and promoted regulatory T cells, this was not enough to promote allograft tolerance in the absence of treatment.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the effect of combining CTLA4Ig abatacept with our previously defined metabolic inhibitor (MI) therapy. This regimen consists of the glucose analog 2DG which blocks glycolysis, the glutamine analog 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) and the diabetes drug metformin (which blocks complex I of the mitochondria). Our data demonstrate that the addition of CTLA4Ig to continuous metabolic therapy not only results in enhanced skin allograft survival but also promotes long-term cardiac allograft acceptance in the absence of maintenance treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 (H-2b), BALB/c (H-2d), FVB/N (H2q), FVB-Tg(CAG-luc,-GFP)L2G85Chco/J (H2q), B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J (H2b) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. 5C.C7 mice were purchased from Taconic Farms.

To this end, we stimulated T cells and performed immunoblot analysis and measured activation parameters, proliferation and cytokine production in the presence of CTLA4Ig or 2DG+metformin+DON (triple metabolic inhibitor (MI) therapy). As expected, T cell activation was impaired by CTLA4Ig, as indicated by reduced phosphorylation of PLC gamma upon early T cell signaling and also reduced expression of the activation marker CD44 (5 and 10 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A,B</xref>). That is, blocking costimulation with CTLA4Ig inhibited TCR-induced signaling necessary for full T cell activation. Alternatively, blocking metabolism with the triple metabolic therapy only minimally affected proximal TCR-induced signaling and expression of CD44. In contrast, CD25 expression, which is induced by both TCR signaling and IL-2 signaling was equally inhibited by MI and costimulatory blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). In light of the important role of mTORC1 signaling in promoting T cell activation, differentiation and function (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), we also examined the effects of costimulatory blockade and MI on mTOR activation. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>, that while early mTORC1 signaling was not affected, both costimulatory blockade and MI led to a marked decrease in mTOR signaling by 24 h.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Effect of metabolic inhibitors (MI) and CTLA4Ig on T cell activation and mTORC1 activity <bold>(A)</bold> Immunoblot analysis of phospho-PLC gamma (Tyr 783) activity in naive CD4+ T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 (Signal 1) and/or anti-CD28 (Signal 2) in the presence of CTLA4Ig (50 &#x003bc;g/ml) or MI (2DG 0.6 mM, metformin 1 mM, DON 5 &#x003bc;M) for 5 and 10 min. <bold>(B&#x02013;D)</bold> Splenocytes from na&#x000ef;ve WT C57BL/6 mice were stimulated with anti-CD3 (1 &#x003bc;g/ml) and cultured in the presence of CTLA4Ig or MI as in <bold>(A)</bold>. <bold>(B)</bold> Expression of the activation marker CD44 on viable CD8+ T cells at 24 h under CTLA4Ig or MI treatment. <bold>(C)</bold> Expression of the activation marker and high affinity IL-2 Receptor CD25 <bold>(D)</bold> T cell activation induced mTORC1 activity determined by the phosphorylation state of the S6 ribosomal protein of viable CD8+ T cells at 1.5, 3, and 24 h. ***<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 ****<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 (one-way ANOVA nonparametric Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test) Data are representative of at least three experiments <bold>(A&#x02013;D)</bold>, (<bold>B&#x02013;D</bold>, <italic>n</italic> = 4 biological replicates).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fimmu-11-00572-g0001"/></fig></sec><sec><title>CTLA4Ig and Metabolic Inhibitors Differentially Affect T Cell Proliferation, Activation Induced Cell Death and Function</title><p>Next, we sought to determine the potential differential effects of costimulatory blockade and MI on T cell proliferation and activation induced cell death. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, unlike CTLA4Ig, MI strongly inhibited proliferation based on cell proliferation dilution (CPD) as cells were not able to fully enter cell cycle based on the expression of the proliferation marker, Ki-67. Having demonstrated that MI more robustly inhibited proliferation compared to costimulatory blockade, we next examined the effect of these regimens on activation induced cell death. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, MI treatment resulted in markedly enhanced apoptosis of undivided T cells as determined by Annexin V positive staining. Thus, when compared to costimulatory blockade, MI inhibits clonal expansion by both blocking proliferation and promoting activation induced cell death. Next, we examined the effect of costimulatory blockade and MI on T cell function. We also observed both IFN-g and Granzyme B (GzB) production were markedly inhibited by both CLTLA4Ig and MI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, to test the ability of CTLA4Ig costimulation blockade and MI in suppressing alloimmune response, we performed BALB/c to C57BL/6 full thickness skin transplants and treated the recipients from the day of surgery with CTLA4Ig or 2DG+metformin+DON. As previously shown (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), blocking glycolysis, OXPHOS and glutamine metabolism significantly increased skin graft median survival time (MST) 38 days) compared to those that received CTLA4Ig (MST 15 days) or no treatment (MST 14 days) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). These findings suggest that CTLA4Ig and metabolic therapy have distinct immunosuppressive effects and that the ability of MI to limit clonal expansion by both preventing proliferation and enhancing activation induced cell death is associated with a more robust ability to prevent skin allograft rejection.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Effect of metabolic inhibitors (MI) and CTLA4Ig on T cell activation and BALB/c (H2d) to C57BL/6 (H2b) complete MHC-mismatched full thickness skin transplantation.

We activated splenocytes with anti-CD3 for 48 h, expanded in media containing IL-2 for 5 days and then re-stimulated with plate bound anti-CD3 and soluble anti-CD28 for additional 48 h in the presence of CTLA4Ig or the metabolic inhibitors. Notably, CTLA4Ig had minimal effect on either proliferation or cytokine production, whereas metabolic therapy still had a partial effect on inhibiting previously activated T cell responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Next, we sought to compare the effects of CTLA4Ig/MI in a transplant model of acute rejection. To this end, we transplanted skin grafts from luciferase+ mice, FVB-Tg(CAG-luc,-GFP)L2G85Chco/J (H2q), to B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J (H2b) recipients and monitored graft viability by tracking the intensity of their bioluminescent signal. Luciferase+ mice have been widely used as donors for monitoring engraftment of transplanted heart, ovary, hepatocyte and islet (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In skin transplants, allogenic grafts lose viability and decrease bioluminescent signal early after day 6 post-surgery. By Day 12, they are rejected completely. In contrast, syngenic grafts maintain the bioluminescent signal over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Given that MI has been shown to be more effective than other conventional immunosuppressive regimens such as cyclosporine or rapamycin in prolonging allograft survival (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), for this acute rejection model, we first treated all the recipients with MI for 10 days to minimize the initial inflammation and stabilize the graft. On Day 10, we paused treatment to induce an alloimmune response and acute rejection, and we resumed treatment after 3 days either with CTLA4Ig or MI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Under CTLA4Ig treatment, total graft loss, as evidenced by bioluminescence and histology, occurred on day 18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3C&#x02013;F</xref>), which is equivalent to the normal rejection time of non-treated allogeneic grafts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figures 1B,C</xref>). With MI, however, graft viability persisted at least for another 7 days. Thus, consistent with previous reports which suggested that memory cells may be resistant to CD28/B7 costimulation blockade (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) MI appeared to be superior to CTLA4Ig in terms of treating acute rejection.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Effect of metabolic inhibitors and CTLA4Ig on pre-activated CD8+ T cells and a model of acute skin allograft rejection<bold>.

To this end, C57BL/6 mice were infected with vaccinia-OVA and treated with CTLA4Ig, MI or CTLA4Ig+MI for 6 days. After 30 days of the primary infection, a secondary infection with listeria-OVA was performed to induce antigen-specific memory recall. This model enables us to specifically track and examine the effect of MI + CTLA4Ig on robustly activated antigen specific T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response was interrogated by Class I OVA+ tetramer staining. The acute response was analyzed in peripheral blood on Day 7 and memory re-call was examined in splenocytes on Day 35, 5 Days after the secondary infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with the ability of MI to robustly inhibit clonal expansion, treatment with MI inhibited the expansion of tetramer+ CD8+ T cells more significantly than CTLA4Ig (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, combination with CTLA4Ig resulted in a more profound inhibitory effect and furthermore, a stronger decrease in T-bet expression of those T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). In addition, we monitored cell proliferation of adoptively transferred CD8+ OTI T cells with acute drug therapy in response to vaccinia-OVA infection. Similar to our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), MI or CTLA4Ig+MI therapy significantly decreased proliferation of transferred CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>).

Following secondary infection (re-challenge), CTLA4Ig combined with MI not only markedly suppressed memory recall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), but also led to a stronger inhibition of IFN-g or Granzyme B secreting CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). Together, these results show that combination therapy of CTLA4Ig with MI had the most robust effect on CD8+ T cell expansion, both during the initial antigen encounter and during memory recall.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Effect of combining MI and CTLA4Ig on a robust model of T cell effector response. <bold>(A)</bold> Schematic of infection model with treatment.

Not surprisingly, CTLA4Ig+MI significantly prolonged skin graft survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Levels of peripherally circulating T cells were analyzed periodically and showed decreased frequency of activated (CD44+) and terminally differentiated (KLRG1+) CD8+T cells during early time points (POD 10 and 20) in the combination group. Regulatory T cells were decreased initially, but then recovered over time (POD 40) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). Additionally, CTLA4Ig+MI strongly inhibited IFN gamma production of CD8+ T cells upon re-challenge <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>) and donor specific antibodies (DSA), were steadily low over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). This correlated with decreased levels of follicular T helper cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>), which is in line with data showing that CTLA4Ig interferes with T cell- B cell help and decrease antibody-mediated rejection (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).

Previously, we have shown that continuous therapy with MI alone could achieve more than 100-day graft survival (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, stopping treatment resulted in rejection of the hearts 80 days later (data not shown). Therefore, we investigated whether costimulatory blockade could be able to improve the efficacy of short-term anti-metabolic therapy. Consistent with previous preliminary studies, treatment with only 30 days of MI resulted in rejection of the grafts ~60 days later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, adding CTLA4Ig the first week after transplant could achieve 100% 100-day graft survival and near 80% 130-day graft survival, which represents 100 days without treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Nevertheless, clinical assessment of the beating scores showed a decline in the beating quality of the transplanted hearts, although to a lesser extent than the MI alone group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). The addition of CTLA4Ig also resulted in an initial decrease in DSA production that then increased after stopping therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>).

However, discontinuation of treatment led to graft rejection. Thus, the overall goal of this study was determine if the addition of CTLA4Ig might promote long-term graft acceptance in the absence of long-term immunosuppressive therapy. To this end, in this current study we have (<bold>i)</bold> Demonstrated distinct immunologic effects between MI and CTLA4Ig therapy (<bold>ii)</bold> The ability of MI therapy to treat acute graft rejection (<bold>iii)</bold> The synergistic ability of MI + CTLA4Ig to prevent skin allograft rejection (<bold>iv)</bold> The ability of short term MI + CTLA4Ig therapy to promote long-term heart allograft acceptance. While our studies specifically focused on the combination of MI + CTLA4Ig, we believe that these results provide the rationale for employing metabolic therapy as a platform for a potential wide variety of tolerance-inducing regimens.</p><p>CTLA4Ig costimulatory blockade is currently widely used in clinical organ transplantation (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Recent long-term clinical trials in kidney transplant patients have shown improved graft function, better cardiovascular/metabolic risk profile and similar patient and graft survival when compared to CNIs. However, these trials also noticed higher rates of acute rejection within the first months post-transplantation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The acute rejection episodes were not typically associated with DSA (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). T cell mediated acute cellular rejection may be alternatively involved and our study demonstrated that anti-metabolic therapy had a more profound effect on suppressing effector T cell function during acute rejection or acute viral infection. Indeed, similar to other immunosuppressive regimens the profound ability of metabolic therapy to block anti-allograft clonal expansion would also suppress clonal expansion in response to concomitant infections. Nonetheless, metabolic therapy has a number of advantages over treatment regimens that include CNIs. First, a major problem of conventional immunosuppression with CNI's is Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) as well as the reactivation of herpes viruses such as CMV. Metabolic therapy on the other hand directly inhibits herpes virus activation as well as inhibits cancer cell growth (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Second, in as much as CNI's inhibit tolerance induction, transplant patients require life-long immunosuppression. Metabolic therapy promotes tolerance thus potentially mitigating the need for prolonged immunosuppression and hence susceptibility to infection. Finally, from a clinical perspective CNIs (and steroids) are associated with multiple adverse events including hyperglycemia, accelerated atherosclerosis, gastro intestinal bleeding, neurotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity all of which are avoided and in some cases (for example metformin and hyperglycemia) improved with metabolic therapy.</p><p>Further, while CTLA4Ig was associated with decreased TCR-induced activation, MI was associated with a marked decrease in clonal expansion. This decrease was mechanistically secondary to both a decrease in proliferation and an increased in activation induced cell death. Along these lines the initial antigen-specific T-cell precursor frequency has been shown to be an important factor in determining the effectiveness of CTLA-4Ig in a murine model of transplantation suggesting that patients with an initially high precursor frequency of alloreactive T cells (poor major histocompatibility complex donor and recipient matching) might also be particularly refractory to treatment with CTLA4Ig costimulatory blockade (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Our data suggest that the addition of MI therapy can help overcome this hurdle. Furthermore, we observed that combination therapy led to further decreased DSA formation by decreasing follicular T helper cells and abrogating T cell- B cell help. Likewise, MI therapy led to a decrease in mTORC1 activation that could further contribute to the ability of MI + CTLA4Ig to promote long-term graft acceptance.</p><p>In as much as we observed graft acceptance in the absence of continued immunosuppression, our results suggest that MI + CTLA4Ig can induce a state of &#x0201c;functional&#x0201d; tolerance. That said, it should be noted that upon stopping therapy we observed an increase in DSA and that in spite of having less fibrosis and more functional heart tissue in the MI + CTLA4Ig treated hearts when compared to the MI treated hearts, we did observe equivalent lymphocytic infiltration POD 100. Also, secondary skin transplants to those recipients in the combination group that survived more than 150 days showed normal rejection of the skin grafts (data not shown), indicating that robust tolerance was not induced. However, neither the heart graft of those recipients rejected after the secondary re-challenge nor the beating quality further decreased. To this end, while our work supports the concept of MI therapy as a platform for inducing tolerance, the details of robustly achieving this goal remain to be determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal procedures were in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Johns Hopkins University.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>GB and JP designed research.
