Tolerance is accompanied by the accumulation of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the pancreas. To test the potential of this therapy outside the window of acute diabetes diagnosis, we substituted autoimmune diabetic mice, with disease duration varying between 4 and 53 days, with syngeneic islets at the time of therapy initiation. Untreated islet recipients consistently showed disease recurrence after 8.2 &#x000b1; 0.7 days, while 32% of aCD3-treated and 48% of CT-treated mice remained normoglycemic until 6 weeks after therapy initiation (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 vs. untreated controls for both treatments, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 CT vs. aCD3 therapy). However, mice that were diabetic for more than 2 weeks before treatment initiation were less efficient at maintaining normoglycemia than those treated within 2 weeks of diabetes diagnosis, particularly in the aCD3-treated group. The complete elimination of endogenous beta cell mass with alloxan at the time of diabetes diagnosis pointed toward the significance of continuous feeding of the islet antigen proinsulin at the time of aCD3 therapy for treatment success. The CT providing proinsulin protected 69% of mice, compared to 33% when an irrelevant antigen (ovalbumin) was combined with aCD3 therapy, or to 27% with aCD3 therapy alone. Sustained tolerance was accompanied with a reduction of IGRP<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> autoreactive T cells and an increase in insulin-reactive (InsB12&#x02013;20 or InsB13&#x02013;2) Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs, with a specific accumulation of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs around the insulin-containing islet grafts after CT with proinsulin. The combination of proinsulin and IL-10 via oral <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> with low-dose aCD3 therapy can restore tolerance to beta cells in autoimmune diabetic mice, also when therapy is started outside the window of acute diabetes diagnosis, providing persistence of insulin-containing islets or prolonged beta cell function.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>type 1 diabetes</kwd><kwd>antigen-specific therapy</kwd><kwd>anti-CD3</kwd><kwd>genetically modified <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic></kwd><kwd>beta cell mass</kwd><kwd>oral tolerance</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003130</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">KU Leuven<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004040</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="29"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="7782"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aberrant recognition of self-antigen(s) by T cells can cause autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). The pursuit for a cure of T1D through restoration of immune tolerance for the pancreatic insulin-producing beta cells is ongoing and encouraging observations have been made in animal models of the disease with some hints of success in humans. Promising interventions include CTLA4-Ig (Abatacept), anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), and high-dose Fc receptor (FcR) non-binding CD3-specific monoclonal antibody (Teplizumab) therapy (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, at present, none of these approaches has reached the clinical practice, as the balance between potential benefits (e.g., restoration of normoglycemia without exogenous insulin dependence) and long-term side effects (e.g., cytokine release and serum sickness syndromes, Epstein-Barr virus reactivation, high infection rates, and systemic immune suppression) is considered unfavorable. Combination therapies using lower doses of highly targetspecific drugs or combinations of low-dose immune modulation therapy and antigen introduced via tolerogenic routes are appealing strategies that are currently being explored in clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03751007; NCT02620332, NCT02837094).</p><p>Most clinical trials focus on newly diagnosed T1D patients, in whom the residual beta cell mass is presumably sufficient to achieve restoration of normoglycemia, provided that the immune system can be arrested in its attack of the beta cells. It is estimated that newly diagnosed T1D patients have a remaining functional beta cell mass of around 25&#x02013;40% of its full capacity (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), but many patients maintain beta cell function for several years after diagnosis (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, the presence of beta cell mass may not be the only argument making interventions in newly diagnosed T1D patients a sweet spot. In animal models, there appears to be a difference in therapeutic efficacy when interventions are applied at the time of diabetes diagnosis, compared to moments outside of this critical window of opportunity, independent of functional beta cell mass (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In addition, the stage of the autoimmune response may potentially affect therapeutic outcome. As such, anti-CD3 (aCD3) monoclonal antibody therapy is most efficacious when applied at diabetes diagnosis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>An interesting approach proposed in recent years is the combination treatment (CT) of low-dose aCD3 therapy with the whole islet antigen proinsulin (PINS) and the pro-tolerogenic cytokine IL-10 administered orally via genetically modified <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> (<italic>L. lactis</italic>) bacteria (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This targeted therapeutic approach consistently showed T1D reversal in around 60% of newly diagnosed non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. The intervention was accompanied by the accumulation of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the pancreas (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This therapy was started in NOD mice on the day of diabetes onset, raising the question of whether this therapy is only applicable around the time of diagnosis or whether the restoration of immune tolerance against the beta cells may also occur at later disease stages when functional beta cell mass further deteriorates and antigen and epitope spreading ensues. Antigen-specific approaches that depend on the induction of immune regulation may be successful in reinstating active immune tolerance toward a broader antigen repertoire due to infectious tolerance and bystander suppression (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In the present study, we designed experiments wherein beta cell mass was substituted by syngeneic islet transplantation in NOD mice with long-duration T1D. We demonstrated that the antigen-based CT was also efficacious outside the window of acute diabetes diagnosis. Success was linked to disease duration, but also to the delivery of a disease-relevant antigen, in this case PINS, which was needed for Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs to become insulin-reactive and home preferentially to insulin-containing islet grafts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>NOD mice were inbred in KULeuven animal facility since 1989 and kept under semi-barrier conditions.

Transplantation was considered successful if the non-fasting blood glucose concentration returned to normal (&#x0003c;200 mg/dL) within 24 h after surgery. Weight and blood glucose concentrations from the tail vein were monitored three times a week after transplantation with an AccuCheck glucometer. Graft survival time was calculated as the number of days before disease recurrence. Mice that remained normoglycemic until 6 weeks after transplantation were considered cured. For non-cured mice, the day of disease recurrence was defined as the first of 2 consecutive days of non-fasting blood glucose concentrations &#x0003e;250 mg/mL. Only mice being diabetic for more than 2 weeks before islet substitution were used for metabolic, histological, and flow cytometric analysis. Experiments were performed at 10 days (when all mice were still normoglycemic), at 6 weeks after treatment initiation [when normoglycemia was maintained (cured)] or at the time of disease recurrence (untreated and non-cured). All mice were sacrificed according to humane end-points (i.e., 20% weight loss or three consecutive maximum blood glucose measurements &#x0003e;600 mg/dL).</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment Groups</title><p>Newly diagnosed diabetic mice were kept under insulin pellets (Linbit&#x02122;; LinShin Canada, Inc., Ontario, Canada) for up to 53 days post-diagnosis, which constituted long-duration T1D mice.

Besides, non-cured mice did respond immunologically to CT, as demonstrated by the strong accumulation of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in the pancreas (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Until now, the potential of aCD3 has not been intensively investigated outside the narrow window of disease diagnosis. Here, we transplanted 500 insulitis-free syngeneic NOD islets into long-duration diabetic mice to restore metabolic control and investigate the potential of the antigen-based CT to establish tolerance even after variable disease durations.</p><p>We previously showed in a small cohort of mice that low-dose aCD3 strongly delayed disease recurrence after islet substitution (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Here, we followed a larger cohort of mice and saw 32% of aCD3-treated mice maintaining normoglycemia and when combined with <italic>L. lactis</italic> bacteria secreting PINS with IL-10 the success rate reached 48%. An important observation is that longer disease duration, specifically to the point of lacking measurable beta cell function, before therapy initiation diminished therapeutic success. However, CT-treated mice were significantly better at avoiding disease recurrence, and therapeutic success was less influenced by disease duration. We propose this is, in part, related to the preservation of residual pancreatic beta cell mass at therapy initiation, since we previously established that CT does not stimulate pancreatic beta cell regeneration (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Many T1D patients are shown to maintain some functional beta cell mass after diagnosis, indicated by detectable C-peptide or insulin RNA/PINS protein, some even after disease duration of over 30 years (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). These people may benefit more from tolerance-restoring interventions that preserve or revive remaining beta cells.</p><p>The mechanisms by which aCD3 monotherapy and CT exert benefit may be dual. These regimens may alleviate (recurrent) autoimmunity directed at (engrafted) beta cells by temporarily eliminating the autoreactive T cells, and by promoting the generation of Tregs, and in case of CT, islet antigen-specific Tregs. The data here point to the necessity of aCD3 in CT to prevent early islet infiltration by autoreactive IGRP<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that are involved in beta cell destruction in both mice and humans (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Antigen-experienced IGRP<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells rapidly accumulate in newly implanted islets, expressing antigen locally, expand while acquiring an effector-memory phenotype and then traffic to the draining LN, the site of activation of naive autoreactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Although we did not study the activation/memory status of IGRP<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, the present data revealed that therapy-cured mice continued to have low frequencies of IGRP<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after 6 weeks, whereas therapy non-cured mice showed frequencies similar to untreated controls, suggestive of a higher degree of clonal expansion in the islets, particularly in the KLN. Studies on autoreactive effector T cells have shown that Tregs can prevent clonal expansion by limiting access to antigen-presenting cells (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Here, we found that mice treated with aCD3 alone or combined with <italic>L. lactis</italic> bacteria secreting PINS with IL-10 had similar frequencies of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs present in the graft and KLN shortly after therapy initiation. However, 6 weeks after therapy initiation, Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs seemed to have partially emigrated from the islet grafts to the KLN. Some interesting studies demonstrated that the presence of Tregs in islets is insufficient to prevent infiltration of autoreactive T cells, suggesting that migration of Tregs into to draining LN may be necessary to sustain tolerance (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Of note, the absolute number of Tregs closely surrounding insulin-containing islets was increased only by the CT, eluding to their potential antigen specificity.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that CT established long-term tolerance to islet antigens in newly diagnosed diabetic mice by generating antigen-specific Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CTLA4<sup>+</sup> Tregs with superior regulatory properties when challenged with the respective autoantigen, without eliminating the autoreactive T cell compartment, implying a resetting of the immunological balance (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Using a humanized mouse, Waldron-Lynch et al. reported that aCD3 induced only a modest and transient T cell depletion, but alternatively triggered the generation of a &#x0201c;gut-homing&#x0201d; CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup>CCR6<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg population, which produced IL-10 on migration to the gut and subsequently returned to the circulation (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Nishio et al. further demonstrated that Treg expansion by aCD3 occurred not through conversion from Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> conventional T cells, but via expansion of a monoclonal Treg population, normally selected and sustained at low frequency (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Interestingly, they also proposed that a minor cytokine storm elicited by aCD3 may actually be a crucial contributing element in the therapeutic effect, via resetting of the Treg niches. We suggest that, when combined with an islet antigen delivered via the tolerogenic (oral) route, low-dose aCD3 may encourage specific modifications in the homeostatic control of the islet antigen-specific repertoire or a phenotypic redistribution, rather than a general Treg expansion.</p><p>The present data support the idea that CT is superior due to the tolerogenic delivery of a diseaserelevant antigen (i.e., PINS) which may preferentially generate or expand islet insulin-reactive Tregs being directed to the intestine by CD3 antibodies which are known to be more suitable for controlling autoimmunity <italic>in situ</italic> than polyclonal Tregs, especially when the islet antigen is still on board (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). By eliminating the local antigen source before therapy initiation using alloxan, we showed the importance of continuous islet antigen feeding on therapeutic success of CT. As we see less Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs around the transplanted insulin-containing islets of aCD3-treated mice (regardless of the presence of OVA), compared to CT-treated mice, autoreactive T cells may be less restrained and can cause further islet destruction due to epitope spreading which recruits other pathogenic effectors. Interestingly, when the combination therapy with the islet antigen PINS was used, increased numbers of insulin-reactive Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs were observed in the islet grafts, yet not in the KLN, indicating that these cells had trafficked to the inflammatory sites where they may suppress persistent effector T cell function. Moreover, the present data suggest that Tregs may control disease recurrence by first migrating to the islet grafts to limit beta cell damage (day 10 post therapy initiation), and then partly retreating to the KLN to maintain tolerance (6 weeks post therapy initiation).</p><p>Taken together, CT greatly reduced IGRP<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> graft infiltration and increased insulin-reactive Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg accumulation, allowing Tregs to dominate around insulin-containing islets. We speculate that these Tregs may persistently interact with memory (autoantigen-experienced) autoreactive T cells, but an imbalance in their numbers might determine the outcome. More insights are needed on how these Tregs control the diverse repertoire of antigen-experienced T cells present in the islets (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Tregs can create a tolerogenic milieu that promotes bystander suppression and infectious tolerance through several mechanisms (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, low-dose aCD3 therapy in combination with oral delivery of <italic>L. lactis</italic> bacteria secreting PINS with IL-10 can bypass autoimmune recurrence in syngeneic islet recipients with long-duration T1D. Therapeutic success depended on disease duration and, thus, in part on endogenous beta cell mass, but also on the continuous oral delivery of islet antigen. Islet (insulin-reactive) Tregs were enriched and curbed progression to beta cell destruction. Integration of these antigen-specific approaches to enhance tolerance and control autoimmunity may help advance therapeutic efficacy in selected patient populations even beyond the window of disease diagnosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets generated for this study are available on request to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal study was reviewed and approved by KULeuven Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>DC, JC, and CG designed the study and performed experiments, interpreted data, and drafted the manuscript.
