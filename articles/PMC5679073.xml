The principal mechanism by which IL-2 promotes T<sub>reg</sub> cell development is by triggering STAT5 activation, which binds to the <italic>Foxp3</italic> locus and promotes Foxp3 expression<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. IL-2 signaling is also required to maintain the competitive fitness of T<sub>reg</sub> cells in secondary lymphoid organs<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and for reinforcing their suppressive activity<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Hence, mice lacking IL-2 or IL-2R&#x003b1; (CD25) fail to maintain peripheral tolerance and develop autoimmune disease<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">T<sub>reg</sub> cells express high amounts of CD25, the &#x003b1; chain of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor, allowing them to effectively compete with other cells for available IL-2<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Indeed, IL-2-consumption by T<sub>reg</sub> cells is one of the main mechanisms by which they prevent effector-T cell (T<sub>eff</sub>) responses<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Conversely, IL-2 consumption by T<sub>reg</sub> cells facilitates CD4<sup>+</sup> T follicular helper (T<sub>FH</sub>) cell development<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, since IL-2 signaling inhibits T<sub>FH</sub> cell differentiation<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Interestingly, some activated T<sub>reg</sub> cells down-regulate CD25, and do not require IL-2 for their homeostatic maintenance<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Instead, their survival is dependent on ICOS&#x02013;ICOS-L interactions<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Similarly, antigen-experienced T<sub>reg</sub> cells in the skin<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and in aged mice<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> express less CD25, and depend on IL-7 and IL-15 rather than IL-2 for their maintenance, thus suggesting that IL-2 might be dispensable for the homeostasis of some T<sub>reg</sub> cell subsets.</p><p id="P5">Interestingly, some Foxp3-expressing T<sub>reg</sub> cells up-regulate Bcl-6 and CXCR5, molecules that are normally expressed by T<sub>FH</sub> cells<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. These Foxp3<sup>+</sup>Bcl-6<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> cells are known as T follicular regulatory (T<sub>FR</sub>) cells<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, which home to B cell follicles where they suppress B cell responses<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. The ability of T<sub>FR</sub> cells to co-express Foxp3 and Bcl-6 is somewhat surprising, as IL-2 signaling is important for Foxp3 expression, but inhibits Bcl-6<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Thus, it is unclear how IL-2 might be involved in the differentiation or maintenance of T<sub>FR</sub> cells.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we investigated the role of IL-2 in T<sub>FR</sub> cell responses to influenza. We demonstrated that high concentrations of IL-2 at the peak of the infection promoted the expression of Blimp-1 in T<sub>reg</sub> cells, which suppressed Bcl-6 expression and thereby precluded T<sub>FR</sub> cell development. As a consequence, T<sub>FR</sub> cells failed to accumulate at the peak of the influenza infection. However, once the virus was eliminated and the IL-2 concentrations declined, some CD25<sup>hi</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells down-regulated CD25, up-regulated Bcl-6 and differentiated into T<sub>FR</sub> cells, which migrated into the B cell follicles to prevent the accumulation of self-reactive B cell clones. Collectively, our data demonstrate that IL-2 signaling differentially controls conventional T<sub>reg</sub> and T<sub>FR</sub> cell responses to influenza virus, and reveal an important role for T<sub>FR</sub> cells in maintaining B-cell tolerance after influenza infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Kinetics of T<sub>FR</sub> cell expansion upon influenza infection</title><p id="P7">To evaluate whether T<sub>FR</sub> cells could be detected after influenza infection, C57BL/6 (B6) mice were intranasally (i.n) infected with influenza A/PR8/34 (PR8) and Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were characterized in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node (mLN) 30 days later (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a&#x02013;c</xref>). Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>lo</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> cells expressed low amounts of Bcl-6 and CXCR5 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). In contrast, Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>hi</sup>CD4+ T cells could be separated into Bcl-6<sup>lo</sup>CXCR5<sup>lo</sup> cells, which were PD-1<sup>lo</sup> and GL-7<sup>lo</sup>, and Bcl-6<sup>hi</sup>CXCR5<sup>hi</sup> cells, which were PD-1<sup>hi</sup> and GL-7 <sup>hi</sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a&#x02013;c</xref>). Thus, we designated the Bcl-6<sup>lo</sup>CXCR5<sup>lo</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as conventional T<sub>reg</sub> cells and Bcl-6<sup>hi</sup>CXCR5<sup>hi</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as T<sub>FR</sub> cells. T<sub>FR</sub> cell development requires SAP-mediated interaction with B cells<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. As such, the frequency and number of Bcl-6<sup>hi</sup>CXCR5<sup>hi</sup> T<sub>FR</sub> cells were decreased in SAP-deficient (B6.<italic>Sh2d1a<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) mice relative to B6 mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). Finally, to show that Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells homed to GCs following influenza infection, we determined the placement of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells relative to B cell follicles and GCs in sections of mLNs obtained from day 30 influenza-infected mice (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). As expected, we identified CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells within the B cell follicles, the interfollicular area and inside the GCs (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a,b</xref>). These results indicated that <italic>bona fide</italic> T<sub>FR</sub> cells did develop following influenza virus infection.</p><p id="P8">We next infected B6 mice with influenza and enumerated T<sub>FR</sub> cells and conventional T<sub>reg</sub> cells in the mLN at different times after infection (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f&#x02013;h</xref>). Bcl-6<sup>hi</sup>CXCR5<sup>hi</sup> T<sub>FR</sub> cells were barely detectable at the peak of the infection (day 7 to 15), but largely accumulated during the late phase of the primary response (day 30 to 60) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f,g</xref>). In contrast, conventional T<sub>reg</sub> cells rapidly expanded between days 3 and 7 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>). Importantly, the paucity of T<sub>FR</sub> cells at the peak of the infection was not due to a lack of GC B cells, since GC B cells were easily detected at day 10, continued to expand through day 15, and declined thereafter (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i,j</xref>). We also observed that Bcl-6<sup>hi</sup>CXCR5<sup>hi</sup> T<sub>FH</sub> cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1k,l</xref>) peaked between days 7 and 15 after infection, and subsequently contracted between days 15 and 30. Thus, in contrast to GC cells, T<sub>FH</sub> cells and conventional T<sub>reg</sub> cells, T<sub>FR</sub> cells failed to accumulate at the peak of the infection.</p><p id="P9">To further confirm this conclusion, we evaluated the presence of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells within the GCs at days 10 and 30 after infection by immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>). Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells were easily detected in the B cell follicles, interfollicular area and GCs on day 30. By contrast, very few Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells were present within the GCs at day 10, despite being abundant in the T cell area. Collectively, these results indicated that the T<sub>FR</sub> cells failed to develop during the peak of the influenza infection, but accumulated in the mLN at later time points.</p><p id="P10">Previous studies have shown that T<sub>FR</sub> cells develop quickly (days 7&#x02013;14) upon immunization with soluble antigens<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. To test whether the delayed appearance of T<sub>FR</sub> cells was unique to influenza, we enumerated T<sub>FR</sub> cells in B6 mice that were either immunized with influenza hemagglutinin (HA) adsorbed to alum (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig.1 d,e</xref>) or infected with LCMV-Armstrong (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1 f,g</xref>). In agreement with the published studies, we found that T<sub>FR</sub> cells were readily detected at day 9 after HA immunization and were maintained for at least 30 days (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1 d,e</xref>). By contrast, T<sub>FR</sub> cells were virtually undetectable at day 9 following LCMV-Armstrong infection, but accumulated in large numbers at day 30 after infection (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1 f,g</xref>). Collectively, these results suggested that, whereas T<sub>FR</sub> cell responses quickly develop following soluble protein immunization, T<sub>FR</sub> cells fail to differentiate at the peak of acute viral infections.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>T<sub>FR</sub> cells exhibit low expression of CD25</title><p id="P11">T<sub>FR</sub> cells depend on Bcl-6<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, whose expression is inhibited by IL-2<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. To examine the relationship between T<sub>FR</sub> cells and IL-2 signaling, we divided the CD69<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell population into CD25<sup>hi</sup> and CD25<sup>lo</sup> cells and analyzed the expression of T<sub>FR</sub> cell markers in these subpopulations (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,c</xref>). We found that CD25<sup>lo</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells, but not CD25<sup>hi</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells, up-regulated T<sub>FR</sub> markers following infection (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,c</xref>). Importantly, although CD25<sup>lo</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells were present at the peak of the infection (d10), they expressed low amount of CXCR5, Bcl-6 and PD-1 relative to later time points, suggesting that lack of T<sub>FR</sub> cells at the peak of the infection was not due to a lack of CD25<sup>lo</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a&#x02013;c</xref>). Similar results were obtained in LCMV-infected mice or HA-Alum-immunized mice (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2d,e</xref>). Thus, unlike conventional T<sub>reg</sub> cells, which are CD25<sup>hi</sup>, T<sub>FR</sub> cells are CD25<sup>lo</sup>.</p><p id="P12">We next evaluated STAT5 phosphorylation in T<sub>FR</sub> and conventional T<sub>reg</sub> cells and found that pSTAT5 was reduced in T<sub>FR</sub> cells compared to conventional T<sub>reg</sub> cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>), suggesting that T<sub>FR</sub> and conventional T<sub>reg</sub> cells responded differently to IL-2. To confirm this conclusion, we sorted conventional T<sub>reg</sub> cells (Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>hi</sup>PD-1<sup>lo</sup>CXCR5<sup>lo</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup>) and T<sub>FR</sub> cells (Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>hi</sup>PD-1<sup>hi</sup>CXCR5<sup>hi</sup>CD25<sup>lo</sup>) from the mLN of day 30 infected B6.Foxp3&#x02013;DTR&#x02013;GFP mice and performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify hallmark-signaling pathways differentially enriched in these populations (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e,f</xref>). Approximately 2,000 genes were differentially expressed between conventional T<sub>reg</sub> and T<sub>FR</sub> cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Importantly, the IL-2&#x02013;STAT5 signaling pathway had the highest normalized enrichment score (NES=3.54; FDR &#x0003c; 0.001) and contained the largest number of genes up-regulated in T<sub>reg</sub> cells relative to T<sub>FR</sub> cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Of the 200 genes in the hallmark IL-2&#x02013;STAT5 signaling pathway, 72 were significantly downregulated in T<sub>FR</sub> vs T<sub>reg</sub> cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 2,3</xref>). Interestingly, despite their low expression of CD25 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>), T<sub>FR</sub> cells expressed high amounts of IL-2R&#x003b2; (CD122) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>), suggesting that T<sub>FR</sub> cells may have some remaining capacity to respond to IL-2, particularly when its physiological concentration is sufficiently high<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Altogether, our results indicated that the IL-2&#x02013;STAT5 signaling pathway was downregulated in T<sub>FR</sub> cells compare to conventional T<sub>reg</sub> cells.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>CD25<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells are the precursors of T<sub>FR</sub> cells</title><p id="P13">Previous studies showed that T<sub>FR</sub> cells differentiate from pre-existing Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> precursors<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Given that T<sub>FR</sub> cells were CD25<sup>lo</sup>, we used adoptive-transfer experiments to test whether T<sub>FR</sub> cells were derived from pre-existing CD25<sup>hi</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> or CD25<sup>lo</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells. Therefore, we sorted CD25<sup>hi</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> or CD25<sup>lo</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the spleen of na&#x000ef;ve B6.Foxp3&#x02013;DTR&#x02013;GFP (CD45.2<sup>+</sup>) mice, which express the diphtheria-toxin receptor and the eGFP genes under the control of the Foxp3 promoter, and adoptively transferred equivalent numbers of these cells into na&#x000ef;ve <italic>Tcrb</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup><italic>Tcrd</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, that lack T cells. We also transferred total CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from B6.CD45.1 mice to provide a competent T-cell environment. One day later, mice were infected with influenza and the donor-derived Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells were characterized on day 30. The frequencies and numbers of activated Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells derived from the CD45.2<sup>+</sup> donors were increased in recipients of CD25<sup>hi</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells compared to recipients of CD25<sup>lo</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). We also found that nearly 6% of the progeny derived from CD25<sup>hi</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells up-regulated Bcl-6 and CXCR5, whereas few of the progeny derived from CD25<sup>lo</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells up-regulated Bcl-6 and CXCR5 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). As a result, the numbers of CD45.2<sup>+</sup> T<sub>FR</sub> cells were significantly higher in recipients of CD25<sup>hi</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells compared to recipients of CD25<sup>lo</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Importantly, the number of CD45.1<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells, and the number of CD45.1<sup>+</sup> T<sub>FR</sub> cells were similar in the two groups (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e,f</xref>).

Although some CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells up-regulated Foxp3 after infection (data not shown), CD45.2<sup>+</sup> T<sub>FR</sub> cells were only generated from CD25<sup>hi</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cell precursors (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g,h</xref>).

To do this, B6 mice were infected with influenza, treated them with either 30,000 units (U) of recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) or PBS for nine consecutive days starting on day 20 and T<sub>FR</sub> cells were enumerated in the mLN on day 30.

Given that IL-2 is highly produced at the peak of the infection, we hypothesized that strong IL-2 signals prevented the differentiation of T<sub>FR</sub> cells at this time.

Correspondently, T<sub>FR</sub> cells fail to accumulate at the peak of the influenza infection, a time during which IL-2 is highly produced. However, after IL-2 withdrawal, some Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells down-regulate CD25, up-regulate Bcl-6, express CXCR5 and differentiate into T<sub>FR</sub> cells, which migrate into the B-cell follicles to prevent self-reactive B-cell responses.
