The balance between Th1 and Th2 cytokine profiles is regulated mainly by interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; (Th1-related) and interleukin (IL)-4 (Th2-related) production. The main sources of these cytokines are TCD4 cells but both cytokines can also be produced or regulated by B cells [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The prevention strategies to regulate allergy development are classified into three levels, with the primary strategy aiming to prevent allergen sensitization, the secondary aiming at the prevention of allergy development in already sensitized individuals, and tertiary aiming at the treatment of the symptoms [<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Primary strategies have been studied by our group in type I hypersensitivity murine models over the last 15 years [<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These models consider three important factors: the maternal immunity during pregnancy, neonatal immunity, and the interaction between the two. The maternal and fetal immune system interaction occurs either through the placenta or through breast-feeding. Previously, we reported that maternal immunization with the dust mite <italic>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</italic> (Dp) can inhibit offspring Th2 exacerbation [<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] characteristics that was also observed after maternal immunization with OVA [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the same work, we also reported that the passive transfer of maternal IgG can modulate offspring IL-10 production, but at the time we did not evaluate the impact of IL-10 upon this mechanism using IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p><p>The B cells that produce IL-10 (B10) have their regulatory function dependent on IL-4 production [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], an important Th2 pattern cytokine. Amu and co-workers noted that B10 cells could prevent and reverse allergic airway inflammation in a similar murine model of immunization with OVA in BALB/c mice [<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, B10 cells can participate in the regulation of IgE production, as shown in an atopic dermatitis-like mouse model [<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and induce regulatory cells, such as Tr1 and nTreg [<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Recently our group has demonstrated, in the same experimental model used in the present work, that maternal preconception immunization with OVA can induce B10 cells in offspring [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but the effect of maternal immunization upon B and T cells cytokine secretion pattern was not evaluated at the time.</p><p>Since our experimental protocol immunizes mothers with allergens, another question that emerges from our results is whether the induction of IgE and Th2 profile needs to be induced in mothers to protect offspring from allergy development. To elucidate this question the use of CD28<sup>-/-</sup> mice can be very useful. These animals are unable to produce IgE in response to allergen sensitization, as shown by the Th1-driven immunity with the predominance of IFN-&#x003b3; production, and because its B/T cell cooperation is compromised [<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Based on this, the present work aims to evaluate, in a complementary way to the data already published by our group, the impact of maternal OVA immunization upon offspring IFN-&#x003b3; (Th1-related) and IL-4 (Th2-related) intracellular production on two main resources of cytokines, TCD4 and B cells. Together with previous results, the understanding of these mechanisms may contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies for allergy inhibition in offspring through maternal immunization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="sec2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 inbred wild type mice (WT) or IL-10 and CD28 genetically deficient (IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> and CD28<sup>-/-</sup>) males and females were used at 8-10 weeks old.

The data are presented as the means &#x000b1;SEM of each group. *<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, compared with the control group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CEJI-43-81345-g007"/></fig><p>This effect was maintained after neonatal immunization (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0370, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Fig. 7C</xref>), and we observed a simultaneous increase in the IFN-&#x003b3; percentage (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0051) and intensity (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0005) in TCD4+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Fig. 7C</xref>) and IFN-&#x003b3; intensity (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0055) in B cells of 3 d.o. offspring derived from immunized mothers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0007">Fig. 7D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our group has already reported that the maternal immunization protocol with OVA in WT mice could down-regulate the intracellular IL-4 production on offspring, suggesting a Th2 inhibition [<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and four years later, we also observed that maternal immunization with a dust mite extract (<italic>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</italic>) could not induce the same cytokine and phenotype profile in offspring cells [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Recently, using the same experimental protocol adopted in the present work, we observed that WT mice derived from OVA-immunized mothers cannot develop pulmonary allergy inflammation in response to the same allergen [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This work reveals that maternal immunization can suppress WT offspring IgE production and pulmonary inflammation, due to regulatory B10 cell induction in offspring.</p><p>Together, our previous observations raised some new questions, and it became necessary to evaluate the <italic>in vivo</italic> contribution of IL-10 and B/T cell collaboration to offspring allergy inhibition.</p><p>To assess the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of IL-10 in this mechanism, IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice were subjected to the same maternal and neonatal immunization protocol with OVA, and the absence of IL-10 resulted in an increased percentage of TCD4+ cells that produced IL-4 in offspring from immunized mothers. Since this increase was not observed in WT mice, it suggests a loss of regulation following Th2 responses in offspring. After neonatal immunization, IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> offspring from immunized mothers showed downregulation upon Th1/Th2 cytokine production, in contrast to WT mice.</p><p>These observations suggest that IL-10 is necessary to induce the regulatory effect of maternal immunization on offspring cells as well as to maintain the Th1/Th2 balance in immunized offspring. This data are in accordance with our recent evidence that maternal immunization exerts its inhibitory effect on offspring mainly by B10 cell induction [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Yoshizaki and collaborators used an autoimmunity model to show that B10 cell induction and regulatory functions depend on cognate B/T cell interactions [<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, our model uses an allergen to induce protection, which cannot ensure that an IgE response has been induced in mothers. Based on that, we decided to subject CD28<sup>-/-</sup> mice to a maternal/neonatal immunization protocol.</p><p>The CD28<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed impaired T-cell responses and a reduced capacity to generate germinal centers [<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For B cells, CD28 deficiency compromised antibody class-switching, producing low-to-undetectable IgE levels and high levels of IgM and IgG antibodies in response to immunization [<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>We observed that the maternal immunization of CD28<sup>-/-</sup> mice, similar to IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice, could not down-regulate the Th2 profile in offspring as observed in WT mice. It is interesting to note that, in both CD28<sup>-/-</sup> and IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice, the augmented IL-4 production in B cells observed in WT offspring from immunized mothers was lost.</p><p>The IL-4 production augments in B cells could be related to B10 cell induction since this population is characterized by autologous IL-4 production to exert its functional activity [<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], thus suggesting that B10 cell induction is possible in both IL-10 and CD28 knockout mice.</p><p>These results reinforce the role of B10 cell induction as a mechanism for the regulation of allergy in offspring. Considering that in this same experimental model it has been described that the induction of B10 cells can be mediated by maternal IgG and that this seems to occur also in human B cells [<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the data generated in this work can support the future development of regulatory therapies for the development of allergies that are mediated by passive antibody transfer as recently proposed by the &#x0201c;MatIgG primary modulation theory&#x0201d; hypothesis [<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, our results reveal, complementarily to previous observations of our group, that offspring allergy and Th2 cytokine profile inhibition mediated by maternal immunization with OVA seems to be dependent on IL-10 and efficient B/T cell collaboration <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded through a grant from the Laboratory of Medical
