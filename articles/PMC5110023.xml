In many infection models, accumulation of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> monocytes at the site of infection is an essential part of this process (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Serbina et al., 2008</xref>). These cells are commonly referred to as inflammatory monocytes and express CCR2, a chemokine receptor that promotes emigration of cells from the bone marrow (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Serbina and Pamer, 2006</xref>). Correspondingly, CCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are highly susceptible to numerous microbial infections because CCR2<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> monocytes fail to exit the bone marrow and traffic to the site of infection (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Serbina and Pamer, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Serbina et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A critical role for CCR2<sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes in immune defense is their ability to differentiate into monocyte-derived DCs (Mo-DCs) at the site of infection (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Peters et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Hohl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Nakano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Osterholzer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Espinosa et al., 2014</xref>). Mo-DCs are typically characterized as Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> CD11b<sup>hi</sup> MHCII<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>int</sup> cells and possess several important functions. In some infection models, such as <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, Mo-DCs include a subset of specialized TNF and inducible nitric oxide synthase&#x02013;producing DCs (Tip-DCs) that express antimicrobial effector functions (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Serbina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Tezuka et al., 2007</xref>). However, a large body of evidence also implicates Mo-DCs in the initiation of adaptive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to a variety of pathogens, including <italic>Mycobacteria tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Peters et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Hohl et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic> (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">W&#x000fc;thrich et al., 2012</xref>), and <italic>Leishmania major</italic> (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Le&#x000f3;n et al., 2007</xref>). In the <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> pulmonary infection model, Mo-DCs transported antigen from the lungs to the draining lymph nodes, suggesting a possible mechanism by which they promote CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell priming (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Hohl et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the differentiation of inflammatory monocytes into Mo-DCs is likely an important step required for the initiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Although in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that GM-CSF and M-CSF influence the differentiation of inflammatory monocytes into Mo-DCs (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bosschaerts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Greter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), the cell types required to direct Mo-DC differentiation during infection have not been extensively investigated.</p><p>Although conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells respond slowly and require signals from specialized DCs for activation, innate-like T cells respond more quickly to infectious assaults, uniquely positioning them to influence early innate events. Mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a subset of innate-like T cells that express an evolutionarily conserved T cell receptor &#x003b1; chain restricted by the nonpolymorphic MHC class I&#x02013;related protein (MR1; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Gold and Lewinsohn, 2013</xref>). MAIT cells are activated by microbial riboflavin metabolite-derived antigens presented by MR1, distinguishing them from all other &#x003b1;&#x003b2; T cells (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Kjer-Nielsen et al., 2012</xref>). Because the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway is unique to microbes, these metabolites are comparable to microbial molecular patterns, indicating that MAIT cells likely participate in early pattern-recognition surveillance. Indeed, MAIT cells quickly secrete IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF, IL-17, and cytotoxic effector mechanisms when stimulated with a wide variety of pathogens in vitro (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Gold et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Le Bourhis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cowley, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2015</xref>). The in vivo importance of MAIT cells is evident in MR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which lack MAIT cells and are impaired in their ability to control infections with <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG, and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Georgel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chua et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Meierovics et al., 2013</xref>). However, thus far little is known about the activities that MAIT cells contribute to the in vivo generation of protective innate and adaptive immune responses.</p><p><italic>F. tularensis</italic> is a Gram negative, facultative intracellular bacterium and the causative agent of tularemia. Classified as a Tier 1 bioterrorism agent, inhalation of virulent strains of <italic>F. tularensis</italic> rapidly progresses to acute lethal disease in up to 60% of untreated patients (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ellis et al., 2002</xref>). The attenuated <italic>F. tularensis</italic> live vaccine strain (LVS) has shown potential as a protective vaccine in animal studies, and has been used as an investigational product in the United States (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dennis et al., 2001</xref>). Although avirulent for humans, <italic>F. tularensis</italic> LVS causes a fulminant pulmonary infection in mice, with an i.n. LD<sub>50</sub> of &#x0223c;10<sup>3</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>4</sup> bacteria (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Elkins et al., 2003</xref>). Importantly, i.n. infection of mice with sublethal doses of <italic>F. tularensis</italic> LVS results in the recruitment of large numbers of MAIT cells to the lungs and offers a convenient platform to study pulmonary MAIT cell immune responses (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Meierovics et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We have previously used the <italic>F. tularensis</italic> LVS murine pulmonary infection model to probe the role of MAIT cells in mucosal immune responses, demonstrating that accumulation of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the lungs of MR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was delayed after respiratory LVS infection (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Meierovics et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to other intracellular pathogens, optimal defense against LVS infection requires conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> and/or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells for clearance, and, correspondingly, MR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibited increased susceptibility and delayed clearance of a sublethal LVS pulmonary infection (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Yee et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Meierovics et al., 2013</xref>). We were therefore interested in determining the mechanisms by which MAIT cells influence early activation and/or recruitment of conventional T cells. Here, we show that MR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibit delayed differentiation of CCR2&#x02013;dependent inflammatory monocytes (defined as Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells) into Mo-DCs (generally defined as Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup> cells) after pulmonary <italic>F. tularensis</italic> LVS infection, and that this early defect impairs the accumulation of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the lungs. We further demonstrate that MAIT cells contribute to early GM-CSF production, and that GM-CSF is necessary for Mo-DC accumulation during LVS pulmonary infection. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for MAIT cells in the promotion of inflammatory monocyte differentiation and the development of DCs that facilitate later adaptive immune responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s02"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Early accumulation of CCR2-dependent CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs in the lungs of MR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is impaired after pulmonary mucosal infection</title><p>To determine whether MAIT cells influence early inflammatory events during in vivo pulmonary infection, we examined myeloid cell numbers in the lungs after sublethal i.n. <italic>F. tularensis</italic> LVS infection.

These cells are not present in the steady state, but differentiate from recently recruited CCR2<sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Hohl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Osterholzer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Greter et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with the model that Mo-DCs mediate adaptive immunity, these cells stimulate robust Th1 responses in vitro, and mice lacking CCR2 exhibit impaired T cell responses during infection (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Peters et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Nakano et al., 2009</xref>). However, thus far little is known about the cell types required to drive Mo-DC differentiation. Because MAIT cells recognize a microbial molecular pattern, possess a memory phenotype, and are present in peripheral tissues (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Rahimpour et al., 2015</xref>), they are in an ideal position to influence early innate immune responses. Here, we show that MR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice recruited normal numbers of inflammatory monocytes to the lungs, but these cells were delayed in their differentiation into Mo-DCs during <italic>F. tularensis</italic> LVS pulmonary infection. Further, adoptive transfer of Mo-DCs to infected MR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice rescued a defect in the recruitment of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to the lungs in these mice. Finally, we show that MAIT cells promote monocyte differentiation into Mo-DCs in a GM-CSF&#x02013;dependent manner in vitro, are required for early GM-CSF production in the lungs in vivo, and that GM-CSF is necessary for Mo-DC accumulation during LVS pulmonary infection. Overall, these results demonstrate that MAIT cells have a critical role in directing the differentiation of recently recruited inflammatory monocytes into Mo-DCs, and that the paucity of these cells impacts later adaptive immune responses.</p><p>Because adoptive transfer of Mo-DCs to MR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice restored their defect in activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell accumulation in the lungs during infection, we further examined this population to better understand their function. Our Mo-DC population expressed a variety of markers that were consistent with lung Mo-DCs identified in other pulmonary infection models, such as CD64 and CD172&#x003b1; (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Greter et al., 2012</xref>). These cells were largely positive for the co-stimulatory markers CD40 and CD86, and intracellular LVS was detected in these cells (5&#x02013;8%). This percentage of infected cells is within the range reported for infected Mo-DCs in the <italic>L. major</italic> (5%) and <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> (17%) models (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Le&#x000f3;n et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Hohl et al., 2009</xref>). A significant percentage of Mo-DCs expressed CCR7 (&#x0223c;13%), which is found on mature DCs and coordinates the migration of these cells to secondary lymphoid tissues (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">F&#x000f6;rster et al., 1999</xref>). Indeed, <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bar-Haim et al. (2008)</xref> identified a similar CD11b<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>int</sup> DC population in the lungs of mice during i.n. LVS infection that migrated to local lymph nodes and harbored intracellular bacteria. Importantly, during <italic>L. major</italic> skin infection and <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> pulmonary infection, CCR2<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> monocytes were recruited to the inflamed tissues, where they differentiated into Mo-DCs locally, acquired antigen, and migrated to regional lymph nodes (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Le&#x000f3;n et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Hohl et al., 2009</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that a subset of the Mo-DC population found in the lungs of LVS-infected mice may transport antigen to draining lymph nodes and promote T cell activation. However, it remains to be determined whether the role of Mo-DCs in this process involves lymph node migration, or whether these cells have other important in situ lung functions such as cytokine and chemokine production. Indeed, Mo-DCs have been shown to produce several inflammatory mediators, including IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-12, TNF, and various chemokines (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Le&#x000f3;n et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Zhan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Ko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Croxford et al., 2015</xref>). It also remains to be determined whether the reduced numbers of Mo-DCs in the lungs of MR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice impacts bacterial growth control. Because Mo-DCs promote activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell accumulation, it is possible that they indirectly affect bacterial clearance. However, MAIT cells also express several products that can contribute to LVS growth control, such as production of IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF, Granzyme B, and IL-17A (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Gold et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dusseaux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Meierovics et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Kurioka et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that their ability to promote Mo-DC accumulation is only one of many mechanisms that can influence the outcome of infection.</p><p>The delayed accumulation of Mo-DCs in the lungs of infected MR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice indicates that MAIT cells have either a direct or indirect role in stimulating inflammatory monocyte differentiation into Mo-DCs. Using in vitro cultures, we found that MAIT cells directly stimulated differentiation of purified Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> bone marrow monocytes, a process largely driven by MAIT cell&#x02013;dependent GM-CSF. Our source of MAIT cells for these studies were V&#x003b1;19iTgC&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>MR1<sup>+/+</sup> mice, which exclusively express the canonical TRAV1-TRAJ33 TCR&#x003b1; gene sequence and are highly enriched for MAIT cells. Typically, such studies would use V&#x003b1;19iTg C&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>MR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice as a negative control, because in theory these mice lack MAIT cells due to the absence of MR1. However, it was recently shown that V&#x003b1;19iTg C&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>MR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice contain a large population of MAIT-like MR1 tetramer-reactive T cells (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Sakala et al., 2015</xref>). These &#x0201c;MAIT-like&#x0201d; cells were functionally responsive to synthetic vitamin B2 antigens, although they were much less reactive than MAIT cells from V&#x003b1;19iTg C&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>MR1<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Because the &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;2 domains of MR1 share sequence and structural similarity with MHC class I, it has been speculated that the MAIT-like T cells found in V&#x003b1;19iTg C&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>MR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are selected by a weak cross-reaction with MHC class Ia (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Sakala et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, in lieu of this control strain, we showed that resident splenic T cells from naive WT mice, which contain very few MAIT cells (0.06% of total &#x003b1;&#x003b2;<sup>+</sup> T cells; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Rahimpour et al., 2015</xref>), lack the capacity to drive monocyte differentiation. In further support of our findings, both human and murine MAIT cells have previously been shown to produce GM-CSF (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Lepore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Rahimpour et al., 2015</xref>). Our data are also consistent with the observation that NKT cell clones directed human monocytes to differentiate into DCs in a GM-CSF&#x02013; and IL-13&#x02013;dependent manner (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Hegde et al., 2007</xref>). For NKT cells, this process required antigen recognition via CD1d. In contrast, we found that MAIT cells stimulated monocyte differentiation in vitro in a MR1-independent manner. Because several studies have demonstrated that cytokines, such as IL-18 and IL-12, can drive MAIT cell IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;production in the absence of cognate antigen (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chua et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Ussher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Sakala et al., 2015</xref>), the existence of a cytokine-driven, MR1-independent route for MAIT cell GM-CSF production is feasible. Whether cognate antigen recognition is required for MAIT cells to direct monocyte differentiation during in vivo infection remains to be determined.</p><p>Although it is broadly accepted that GM-CSF promotes the differentiation of monocytes into DCs in vitro (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Scheicher et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Osterholzer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Helft et al., 2015</xref>), the in vivo role for GM-CSF in this process remains controversial. GM-CSF was required for the accumulation of Mo-DCs in antigen-induced peritonitis and LPS-induced lung inflammation, as well as in acute inflammatory arthritis (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Louis et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, GM-CSF was dispensable for Mo-DC differentiation in thioglycollate-induced peritonitis and LPS-induced spleen inflammation (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 2011</xref>), as well as several infection models (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Greter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Ko et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies by <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Greter et al. (2012)</xref> identified a critical role for M-CSF in Mo-DC development during LPS-induced spleen inflammation and i.n. influenza infection. These cumulative data suggest that the requirement for GM-CSF or M-CSF in promoting Mo-DC accumulation depends on the nature of the inflammatory stimulus. In the LVS pulmonary infection model, we found that few inflammatory monocytes and Mo-DCs present in the lungs expressed the M-CSF receptor (CD115), but were almost entirely positive for the GM-CSF receptor. <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Sk&#x000f6;ld and Behar (2008)</xref> similarly noted a lack of high CD115 expression by myeloid subsets in the lungs during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> pulmonary infection. We further found that GM-CSF, but not M-CSF, significantly increased in the lungs of WT mice early after i.n. LVS infection, and that this increase in pulmonary GM-CSF was delayed in MR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Collectively, these data implicated GM-CSF, rather than M-CSF, in the delayed differentiation of Mo-DCs in MR1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice during LVS infection. This is additionally supported by our finding that GM-CSF&#x02013;deficient mice exhibited normal accumulation of inflammatory monocytes, but impaired differentiation of monocytes into Mo-DCs. Our results are consistent with the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> pulmonary infection model, whereby GM-CSF&#x02013;deficient mice exhibited impaired accumulation of Mo-DCs in the lungs (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Overall, our data demonstrate that GM-CSF promotes monocyte differentiation into Mo-DCs during LVS pulmonary infection, and that MAIT cells are essential for the initial production of GM-CSF during the early stages of infection.</p><p>Because the MAIT cell population in murine lungs during the first week of LVS infection is small, and we currently lack specific markers to distinguish MAIT cells from other T cells, and we cannot conclusively state whether MAIT cells produce GM-CSF in vivo themselves or induce GM-CSF production by other cells in the lungs. However, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Rahimpour et al. (2015)</xref> used a MR1 tetramer to demonstrate that MAIT cells in naive mouse lungs predominantly expressed the transcription factor ROR&#x003b3;t, and were potent producers of IL-17. Notably, ROR response elements have been identified in the <italic>csf2</italic> promoter region, and ROR&#x003b3;t drove GM-CSF gene expression in Th17 cells in an IL-23&#x02013;dependent manner during autoimmune neuroinflammation (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Codarri et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that the ROR&#x003b3;t<sup>+</sup> MAIT cell population present in naive mouse lungs has the potential to produce GM-CSF if exposed to the correct cytokine environment. Indeed, MAIT cells circulating in the mucosal tissues of naive mice may be ideally programmed to produce GM-CSF upon microbial exposure.</p><p>Our data support a model whereby MAIT cell&#x02013;dependent GM-CSF production directs Mo-DC differentiation during the early stages of LVS pulmonary infection, and that this influences the magnitude of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Several lines of evidence suggest that enhancing GM-CSF levels during vaccination promotes vaccine-induced immune responses. For example, administration of GM-CSF DNA in conjunction with several different DNA vaccines enhanced both cellular and humoral immune responses (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Geissler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Barouch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Yoon et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, i.n. administration of a GM-CSF&#x02013;expressing BCG vaccine to mice increased migration of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to the lungs and amplified BCG-induced protection against pulmonary TB challenge (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Nambiar et al., 2010</xref>). However, because overexpression of GM-CSF in the lungs impaired protective immunity to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Szeliga et al., 2008</xref>), these data suggest that GM-CSF levels must be carefully regulated to function as an adjuvant. Importantly, compounds that encourage MAIT cell activation may function as effective adjuvants by inducing MAIT cells to promote early immune responses such as GM-CSF production, which have the potential to amplify critical elements of adaptive immunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s09"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s10"><title>Bacteria</title><p><italic>F. tularensis</italic> LVS (ATCC) was grown and frozen as previously described (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Fortier et al., 1991</xref>).
