Here we evaluate a panel of chemically modified mRNA vaccines expressing different forms of the RSV F protein, including secreted, membrane associated, prefusion-stabilized, and non-stabilized structures, for conformation, immunogenicity, protection, and safety in rodent models. Vaccination with mRNA encoding native RSV F elicited antibody responses to both prefusion- and postfusion-specific epitopes, suggesting that this antigen may adopt both conformations in vivo. Incorporating prefusion stabilizing mutations further shifts the immune response toward prefusion-specific epitopes, but does not impact neutralizing antibody titer. mRNA vaccine candidates expressing either prefusion stabilized or native forms of RSV F protein elicit robust neutralizing antibody responses in both mice and cotton rats, similar to levels observed with a comparable dose of adjuvanted prefusion stabilized RSV F protein. In contrast to the protein subunit vaccine, mRNA-based vaccines elicited robust CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in mice, highlighting a potential advantage of the technology for vaccines requiring a cellular immune response for efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Vaccines</kwd><kwd>Virology</kwd><kwd>RNA vaccines</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100009947</institution-id><institution>Merck &#x00026;

Worldwide, ~1.5% of infants are hospitalized with RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) with an estimated mortality rate of 118,200&#x02013;149,400 deaths in children under the age of 5 every year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> In adults, the severity of medically attended RSV infection increases with age. On average, ~5% of older adults are infected with RSV annually, resulting in an estimated 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths each year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Despite the clear medical need for an RSV vaccine and the advancement of multiple candidates to clinical trials, a licensed RSV vaccine is not yet available.</p><p id="Par3">The RSV F protein is a type I fusion glycoprotein that is conserved between clinical isolates, including the RSV-A and RSV-B antigenic subgroups. RSV F protein is an attractive vaccine target, both because it is relatively well conserved among serotypes and because neutralizing antibodies elicited by natural RSV infection predominantly target RSV F.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> F protein transitions between two well-characterized conformations; a metastable prefusion conformation and a stable postfusion conformation. Although epitopes targeted by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies exist on both conformations, characterization of the natural human immune response to RSV infection revealed that most RSV-neutralizing antibodies bind the prefusion conformation of the F protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> The elucidation of the crystal structure of RSV F protein trapped in the prefusion conformation through binding to a prefusion-specific monoclonal antibody has facilitated sophisticated structure-based design predictions of mutations that stabilize the prefusion conformation and generated improved immune responses to RSV in preclinical models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> One of these stabilized forms of RSV, termed DS-Cav1, has demonstrated robust immunogenicity in a Phase 1 clinical trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup></p><p id="Par4">Developing an RSV vaccine poses distinct sets of challenges for both the infant and older adult target populations. Protection provided by passive transfer of maternal antibodies or palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting RSV F, in RSV-na&#x000ef;ve infants suggests that neutralizing antibodies are sufficient to protect against severe LRTI caused by RSV in this population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> However, the development of whole inactivated or subunit-based vaccines for infants has been stymied by the immune pathology elicited by a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine candidate (FI-RSV).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> In contrast to infants, the vast majority of adults have been naturally infected with RSV and have detectable neutralizing antibody titers. While the immune requirements for protection against RSV-associated disease in the elderly are less understood, lower humoral responses to RSV F and G proteins, and a decrease in nasal RSV-specific IgA have been identified as risk factors for RSV disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> Waning cellular immunity may also play a role in RSV infection in the elderly, as older adults have fewer RSV-specific CD8+ T-cells and increased numbers of regulatory T-cells, with a bias towards a Th2 functional phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup></p><p id="Par5">Nucleic acid-based vaccines consisting of in vitro transcribed mRNAs encapsulated within lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for effective cellular delivery have the potential to transform vaccine research and development. They allow for the rapid generation of candidate antigens for preclinical evaluation, and elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses, as well as offering a consistent platform for vaccine manufacturing. Formulation of the mRNA antigen within an LNP improves the immune response to the vaccine, presumably by both protecting the mRNA from enzymatic degradation and facilitating efficient uptake and intracellular release of the mRNA in target cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> For effective mRNA immunization, the vaccine mRNA may be modified to incorporate naturally occurring bases to reduce the inflammatory response to the vaccine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> Importantly, immunization with chemically modified mRNA encapsulated within a lipid nanoparticle was found to be safe and immunogenic in humans following a Phase 1 clinical trial using an mRNA vaccine targeting H10N8 influenza.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup></p><p id="Par6">Here we evaluated LNP-encapsulated chemically modified mRNA vaccines encoding various forms of RSV F protein in rodent models of immunogenicity and protection against RSV challenge.

Additionally, cotton rats vaccinated with mRNA/LNP vaccines are completely protected against challenge with RSV-A and RSV-B and did not develop vaccine enhanced respiratory disease (VERD), unlike cotton rats immunized with FI-RSV.

The conformation of transmembrane forms of RSV F were evaluated using flow cytometry. Increasing amounts of mRNAs expressing transmembrane forms of RSV F (mF, mDS-Cav1, RSV F7) were transfected into Expi293F cells. The transfected cells were stained with conformation-indicating antibodies, including D25, 4D7, and AM14, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Binding of D25 antibody indicates the presence of the antigenic site &#x003a6; found on prefusion F protein, binding of 4D7 indicates postfusion RSV F or an intermediate conformation, and binding of AM14 indicates the trimeric form of prefusion RSV F.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> The results are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The mF mRNA led to expression of a mixed population of prefusion and postfusion RSV F. Of the cells expressing RSV F, close to half bound only to 4D7, with another 30&#x02013;40% binding both 4D7 and D25 or 4D7 and AM14. These observations suggest that, as has been described for RSV F in the context of the virus, the RSV F protein is initially expressed on the surface of the cell in its trimeric prefusion conformation, but then can flip into the more thermodynamically stable postfusion conformation. Similar to mF mRNA, cells transfected with RSV F7 mRNA primarily bound 4D7. Approximately two-thirds of the cells expressing RSV F7 bound to both 4D7 and D25; however, the lack of AM14 binding suggested that the protein did not complete maturation into its fully cleaved and trimeric conformation. In contrast, the mDS-Cav1 mRNA transfected cells had ~3-fold higher D25 binding relative to 4D7 binding and roughly twice as many cells binding AM14 as bound 4D7, indicating the mRNA could be translated into trimeric prefusion F protein in vitro.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Percentage of cells transfected with mRNAs expressing membrane-associated forms of RSV F protein that are bound by D25, 4D7, or AM14.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>mRNA (&#x000b5;g)</th><th>D25+ (%)</th><th>4D7+ (%)</th><th>AM14+ (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>mF</italic></td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>0.17</td><td>2.2</td><td>1.3</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>0.3</td><td>6.0</td><td>2.1</td><td>7.9</td></tr><tr><td>0.8</td><td>20.4</td><td>13.7</td><td>9.4</td></tr><tr><td>1.7</td><td>27.4</td><td>39.7</td><td>20.8</td></tr><tr><td>2.5</td><td>26.1</td><td>40.4</td><td>22.0</td></tr><tr><td><italic>mDS-Cav1</italic></td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>0.17</td><td>0.4</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.4</td></tr><tr><td>0.3</td><td>2.7</td><td>1.7</td><td>1.9</td></tr><tr><td>0.8</td><td>15.4</td><td>3.9</td><td>8.8</td></tr><tr><td>1.7</td><td>36.7</td><td>14.9</td><td>21.6</td></tr><tr><td>2.5</td><td>44.9</td><td>12.4</td><td>27.4</td></tr><tr><td><italic>RSV F7</italic></td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>0.17</td><td>4.9</td><td>18.5</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>0.3</td><td>10.3</td><td>32.9</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>0.8</td><td>45.7</td><td>80.6</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr><td>1.7</td><td>63.2</td><td>88.9</td><td>0.8</td></tr><tr><td>2.5</td><td>62.7</td><td>91.7</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td><italic>no mRNA</italic></td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02013;</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02013;</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02013;</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.2</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02013;</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.3</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02013;</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.8</td><td>0.5</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par9">The conformation of secreted forms of RSV F (sF, sDS-Cav1, RSV F5, RSV F8) was evaluated by sandwich ELISA of culture medium taken from cells transfected with their respective mRNAs (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

Palivizumab binds to an epitope present in both prefusion and postfusion forms of RSV F protein and therefore, like total IgG titers, provides a measure of the overall immune response to each mRNA expressed antigen. In contrast, D25 and 4D7 specifically recognize the prefusion and postfusion conformations of F protein, respectively. Overall, mRNA vaccines expressing native forms of RSV F (mF, sF, and RSV F7) elicited modestly but not significantly higher PCA titers than and comparable DCA titers to the prefusion stabilized vaccines, possibly indicating relatively higher expression levels of these antigens in vivo. These mRNAs elicited overall higher 4D7 competing antibody titers, suggesting that a greater fraction of the expressed protein was in the postfusion conformation; however the presence of DCA in animals immunized with non-stabilized form of RSV-F suggests that the expressed antigens may transition from prefusion to postfusion conformations. In contrast, the sDS-Cav1, mDS-Cav1, and RSV F8 mRNAs, which include mutations designed to stabilize the prefusion conformation of RSV F, have higher DCA and relatively lower 4D7 competing antibody titers relative to PCA titers, supporting the interpretation that these mRNAs express RSV F protein that is predominantly in the prefusion conformation. Finally, the RSV F5 mRNA, which does include prefusion stabilizing mutations elicits an intermediate competing antibody titer, with all titers close to the limit of detection in the respective assays, suggesting that the protein is poorly expressed in mice. Interestingly, immunization with DS-Cav1 protein/Adju-Phos&#x000ae; resulted in relatively low DCA and relatively high 4D7 competing antibody titers. This was unexpected given that in vitro characterization of the protein antigen prior to immunization showed strong D25 binding and poor 4D7 binding (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The sDS-Cav1 mRNA/LNP vaccine may elicit relatively higher D25 competing antibody titers relative to the DS-Cav1 protein because it is presented to the immune system immediately following translation and therefore may experience less loss of prefusion conformation following stress associated with purification, formulation, and routine handling prior to injection into the mouse compared with the protein antigen.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>mRNA/LNP vaccines elicit conformation-indicating antibody titers in mouse.</title><p>BALB/c mice (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5&#x02013;6) were immunized twice with 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;g mRNA/LNP vaccine or DS-Cav1 protein formulated with Adju-Phos&#x000ae;.

In contrast to viral vectored vaccines where anti-vector immune responses may limit the ability to utilize the platform for boost immunizations, mRNA vaccines can be delivered multiple times without immune interference, and mRNA vaccine candidates can be produced at higher throughput.</p><p id="Par21">RSV F protein is an ideal antigen for demonstrating the value of the mRNA/LNP platform, because of the labile nature of the more immunogenic prefusion conformation of the antigen. Since the failure of the purified F protein (PfP) and F/G/M RSV vaccines, which were based on RSV F or multi-antigen preparations extracted directly from RSV, a number of groups have explored engineered forms of RSV F protein designed to improve the stability and/or immunogenicity of the antigen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> For recombinant protein-based vaccines in general, the resulting immunogenicity of the antigen is intrinsically related to the cell line used to express the antigen, as well as the methods used to purify the antigen, which will impact the nature of post-translational modifications to the antigen and/or the conformation of the antigen, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> Nucleic acid vaccination may allow for an improved immune response to conformation dependent antigens such as RSV F because the vaccine antigen is translated by host cells and is then presented to the immune system immediately upon translation. Here we used a mRNA/LNP vaccine platform to compare different forms of RSV F in rodent models and showed that these vaccines were both immunogenic and protective against RSV A and B challenge.</p><p id="Par22">The forms of RSV F protein that were tested as mRNA vaccines included both full length and ectodomain forms, monomeric and trimeric, prefusion stabilized and nonstabilized forms of the antigen. Little difference was observed in the serum neutralizing antibody produced following immunization with full length compared with ectodomain forms of RSV F (mF versus sF; mDS-Cav1 versus sDS-Cav1, Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, and Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). We initially evaluated a number of RSV F antigens that included mutations designed to stabilize RSV F in its prefusion conformation, but then focused our analysis of prefusion stabilized antigens on those containing the well-characterized DS-Cav1 mutations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Somewhat surprisingly, the neutralizing antibody titers elicited by prefusion stabilized versus non-stabilized forms of RSV F (mF versus mDS-Cav1 and sF versus sDS-Cav1) were not improved by incorporation of the DS-Cav1 mutations in either mouse or cotton rat (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). One possibility for this observation may be that following translation of wild type forms of RSV F, the antigen initially achieves a prefusion conformation long enough to elicit antibody responses. This possibility is supported by the observation of DCA titers in mice and cotton rats immunized with mF and sF mRNAs, and the ability of D25 to bind to cells expressing the mF mRNA (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The observation of higher DCA:PCA ratios in mouse and cotton rat immunized with mDS-Cav1 and sDS-Cav1 compared with mF and sF suggests that the mDS-Cav1 and sDS-Cav1 antigens are stabilized in the prefusion conformation in vivo as designed.</p><p id="Par23">The incorporation of competitive antibody binding assays for prefusion and postfusion conformation-indicating antibodies resulted in some surprising observations. In addition to the common practice of measuring levels of palivizumab competing antibodies, we assayed sera from immunized mice and cotton rats for antibodies that compete with D25 (site &#x003a6;) for binding to the DS-Cav1 prefusion F protein and for antibodies that compete with 4D7 which binds to antigenic site I in the postfusion form of RSV F.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> In both mice and cotton rats, we observed that mRNA vaccines expressing forms of RSV F lacking prefusion stabilizing mutations elicited higher 4D7 competing antibody titers, while mRNA vaccines expressing prefusion stabilized RSV F had higher D25 competing antibody titers relative to overall antigen expression as determined by PCA. We also observed antigen-specific differences between mouse and cotton rat immune responses. Mice immunized with DS-Cav1 protein had low DCA titers and higher 4D7 competing titers, while cotton rats immunized with DS-Cav1 protein/Adju-Phos&#x000ae; had high DCA titers and low 4D7 competing titers, suggesting the potential for greater sensitivity to RSV antigenic site I in the BALB/c mouse model. In both mice and cotton rats, we found that the mDS-Cav1 mRNA vaccine elicits both DCA and 4D7 competing antibodies in mice and cotton rats, suggesting either that the mDS-Cav1 mRNA is translated into a mixed population displaying antigenic epitopes associated with both prefusion and postfusion conformations, or that the membrane-associated prefusion form of F protein maintains antigenic site I to a greater degree than the soluble form.</p><p id="Par24">The use of the mRNA platform for immunization may provide additional benefit in improving the cellular immune response to vaccination relative to vaccination with a protein antigen. We observed a robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response to RSV F peptides in all mice immunized with mRNAs expressing forms of RSV F. The different forms of RSV F mRNA vaccines led to roughly equivalent cellular immune responses, although the membrane-associated forms of wild type and DS-Cav1 RSV F did elicit higher CD4+ T cell responses than the secreted forms of these antigens. Importantly, the DS-Cav1 protein/Adju-phos&#x000ae; vaccine elicited little to no cellular immunity in mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The observed lack of CD4 response to DS-Cav1 protein/Adju-phos&#x000ae; compared with mRNA vaccines expressing similar antigens (sDS-Cav1 or mDS-Cav1) may underlie the generally lower quality humoral response observed to the protein-based vaccine in mice, where neutralizing antibody and DCA titers were reduced relative to vaccination with the corresponding sDS-Cav1/LNP mRNA vaccine (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">Overall, a comparison of the different forms of RSV F evaluated reveals that there were differences in the quality of the immune response elicited by the different forms of RSV F. Antigens including the prefusion stabilizing DS-Cav1 mutations elicited higher DCA titers relative to either PCA or 4D7 competition ELISA titers, indicating that more of the neutralizing antibody response elicited by these antigens is directed against antigenic site &#x02205;. As antigenic site &#x02205; is predominant in the natural human immune response to RSV, it may be preferable to select an antigen containing the DS-Cav1 mutations, which support greater presentation and stabilization of this epitope compared to wild type RSV. Despite the increased in DCA in mDS-Cav1 and sDS-Cav1, the neutralizing antibody titer elicited in mice and cotton rats was not increased relative to mF or sF in mice or cotton rats. This may be due to differences in antigen expression in vivo, or the mutations incorporated into the antigens to stabilize the prefusion conformation may either impact the overall stability of the molecule or may not completely lock in the prefusion conformation in vivo. Although the mDS-Cav1 mRNA elicited higher 4D7 competing antibody titers than sDS-Cav1 in both cotton rats and mice, the mDS-Cav1 mRNA vaccine also elicited significantly higher CD4+ T-cell responses in mice than the sDS-Cav1 mRNA, which should be considered when selecting antigens for further evaluation.</p><p id="Par26">A significant challenge for the development of RSV vaccines is the need to demonstrate vaccine safety. Early studies evaluating FI-RSV vaccination in na&#x000ef;ve infants established the potential for VERD leading to significant increases in hospitalization and death following RSV infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> The cotton rat has been widely used to evaluate candidate vaccines for safety prior to clinical testing. We demonstrated that our candidate mRNA vaccines do not carry the same safety liabilities as FI-RSV. Although lung pathology was observed in the unvaccinated, RSV-challenged animals following RSV challenge, cotton rats vaccinated with mF mRNA/LNP or mDS-Cav1 mRNA/LNP and subsequently challenged with RSV had lung pathology scores that were not significantly different than unimmunized animals. Importantly, alveolitis scores were significantly lower than those recorded for FI-RSV immunized animals. As VERD following RSV infection has been associated with a Th2 biased immune response, we assessed cytokine gene expression in the lungs of the vaccinated and RSV-challenged animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> As described by others, IFN-&#x003b3; was upregulated in both unvaccinated animals and in those vaccinated with FI-RSV following RSV challenge, correlating with RSV infection; in contrast the expression of the Th2-associated cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, was upregulated in animals vaccinated with FI-RSV, but not in unvaccinated controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> In contrast, cytokine expression in the lungs of cotton rats vaccinated with mF or mDS-Cav1 mRNA/LNP vaccines and then challenged with RSV is significantly diminished compared with FI-RSV immunized animals and appears most similar to animals that were neither vaccinated nor RSV-challenged. The data suggest that both mRNA vaccines prevented RSV infection and the accompanying inflammatory response associated with infection; however, to build more confidence in vaccine safety, the vaccine ultimately selected for clinical evaluation will need to be evaluated for VERD induction in cotton rats following immunization using a suboptimal vaccine dose prior to testing in seronegative infants or toddlers.</p><p id="Par27">In summary, we have evaluated mRNA vaccines expressing multiple forms of RSV F in mouse and cotton rat models. While mRNA vaccines expressing both prefusion stabilized and wild type forms of RSV F protein elicit robust neutralizing antibodies and equivalent levels of protection in cotton rats, RSV F antigens including the DS-Cav1 prefusion stabilizing mutations elicited a greater proportion of antibodies targeting antigenic site &#x02205;, but do not result in increased neutralizing antibody titer in mice or cotton rats. Regardless of the form of RSV F expressed, mRNA vaccines elicited significantly higher CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in mice compared with the DS-Cav1 protein antigen, although membrane-associated forms of RSV F do appear to elicit higher CD4 responses. Finally, mRNA vaccines expressing forms of RSV F do not lead to VERD in cotton rats. Taken together, these data support the continued evaluation of mRNA vaccines expressing RSV F as vaccine candidates for the prevention of RSV disease.
