A number of compounds including small molecules, peptides, and cytokines have been fused to, conjugated to, or coformulated with SA for improved drug delivery to disease lesions. SA-binding fatty acid&#x02013;modified insulin analog (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>), SA-fused interferon-&#x003b1; (IFN-&#x003b1;) (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>), and SA nanoparticle&#x02013;formulated paclitaxel (Abraxane) have been developed (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>). In these cases, the exceptionally long plasma half-life and/or hydrophilicity of SA contributes to improved pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of the drugs (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Moreover, SA can passively target tumors through the pathological permeability of the tumor vasculature (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>), which is an advantage of SA-based drugs for cancer therapy.</p><p>On the basis of the rationale that combined passive and active targeting is beneficial in tumor drug delivery (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>), molecular engineering approaches aiming for further improvement of SA-based drugs have been explored, such as incorporation of the targeting ligands cyclic arginylglycylaspartic acid peptide (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>) or mannose-6-phosphate to SA (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>). However, superior antitumor efficacy of modified SA has been shown compared to free drugs but not to drugs associated with unmodified SA in either case. Recently, we have shown the targeted delivery of checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) antibodies and the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) using a collagen-binding domain (CBD), namely, the A3 domain of von Willebrand factor (VWF) (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). The A3 domain of VWF has the highest affinity for collagen type I and type III among reported nonbacterial origin proteins/peptides (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>). Collagens are not accessible in most tissues due to the low permeability of the vasculature, yet are abnormally exposed to the bloodstream in the tumor microenvironment due to the hyperpermeability of the tumor vasculature (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>). Thus, collagens are promising targets for cancer drug delivery. In addition, collagens are overexpressed in multiple types of cancers (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>). CBD-CPI and CBD&#x02013;interleukin-2 (IL-2) showed significantly stronger antitumor effects compared with their unmodified forms in multiple murine cancer models (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). In addition, treatment-related adverse events of CPI and IL-2 were greatly suppressed by conjugating or fusing CBD, which demonstrates the usefulness of the CBD-based tumor-targeting strategy (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). Here, we hypothesized that the CBD would be compatible with SA-based drug delivery carriers, because both CBD and SA target vasculature permeability, and CBD fusion adds active targeting ability to SA.</p><p>Doxorubicin (Dox) is a small-molecule anticancer drug that is approved for treating a broad spectrum of cancers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Dox internalizes within cells via passive transmembrane diffusion and interferes with DNA functions, leading to death of proliferating cells. Although Dox treatment prolongs survival of some populations of patients, antitumor efficacy is not notable partially due to acquired drug resistance. The poor therapeutic index of Dox also limits its therapeutic use. Considerable toxicity of Dox has been reported in the clinic, including bone marrow suppression, excessive inflammation, and cardiotoxicity (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>). To improve efficacy, Dox is often used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Recently, Dox has been reported to facilitate immune cell infiltration into tumors through induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD) (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>), suggesting the possibility of synergizing in combination treatment with CPI (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>). Other approaches to improving efficacy and maximum tolerated dose of Dox are liposomal formulation (Doxil) (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>) and use of a maleimide derivative of Dox with a pH-sensitive cleavable linker (aldoxorubicin), which was developed to achieve conjugation with cysteine-34 (in the human sequence) of circulating SA in situ (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>). Aldoxorubicin displays extended blood half-life and accumulation within tumors through passive tumor targeting. The low pH within the tumor tissue (reportedly pH 6.5) allows Dox release from the conjugate with SA. Aldoxorubicin showed improved maximum tolerated dose and efficacy in mouse cancer models (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>) and in a clinical trial (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>) compared to unmodified Dox.</p><p>Here, we designed recombinant mouse SA (CBD-SA) in which the N terminus is fused with the C terminus of the VWF A3 domain, and aldoxorubicin was conjugated to CBD-SA via a pH-dependent cleavable hydrazone linkage before injection (namely, Dox-CBD-SA) (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>). We evaluated engineered CBD-SA as a tumor-targeted drug carrier, leading to improved antitumor efficacy by efficient Dox delivery to the tumor microenvironment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" disp-level="1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>CBD-SA binds to collagen and can be conjugated to Dox</title><p>We synthesized Dox-CBD-SA conjugates to target the tumor microenvironment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). We first investigated the binding abilities of CBD-SA to recombinant collagen protein in vitro. SA was expressed recombinantly with the CBD on the N terminus of mouse SA using a (GGGS)<sub>2</sub> linker (table S1). The molecular weight of CBD-SA was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization&#x02013;time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (fig. S1). We observed strong binding affinities [nanomolar range dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) values] of CBD-SA to collagen type I and type III (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and fig. S2). For Dox conjugation, we first thiolated the lysine residues of CBD-SA using 2-iminothiolane (also known as Traut&#x02019;s reagent). Then, aldoxorubicin was covalently conjugated to CBD-SA. Unmodified SA was also conjugated with aldoxorubicin in the same way (Dox-SA). SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under nonreducing conditions showed that purified Dox-SA and Dox-CBD-SA are monomeric (fig. S3). Before and after Dox conjugation, the hydrodynamic size of CBD-SA was measured (fig. S4). The results also showed that CBD-SA exists in a monomeric form, and Dox conjugation did not alter this character even after a lyophilization/reconstitution cycle. Approximately three Dox molecules were conjugated per SA molecule and per CBD-SA molecule (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Notably, our conjugation method would not affect the binding ability of CBD-SA to collagens since there are no cysteine or lysine residues at the binding interface between the VWF A3 domain and human collagen III (Protein Data Bank: 4DMU; fig. S5) (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>). This interface is also far from the C-terminal fusion site to the SA domain.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Synthesis and characterization of Dox-CBD-SA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of CBD-SA mediated drug delivery.

After 48 hours of incubation, Dox release from Dox-CBD-SA reached a maximum at pH 5.0 and 6.5 (reported tumor microenvironment condition). In contrast, only about 20% of Dox was released at pH 7.4 after 48 hours. Dox-SA showed similar release profiles (fig. S6).

Because Dox is a major drug for breast cancer (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>), here we chose mouse mammary tumor virus-polyomavirus middle T antigen (MMTV-PyMT) murine breast cancer as an experimental model. The MMTV-PyMT cells were cultured in the presence of Dox or Dox conjugates, and then their intracellular uptake was assessed (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). After 1 hour of incubation, free Dox was detected in the cytoplasm, intracellular acidic organelles, and preferentially in the nucleus, indicating that its delivery is mediated by passive transmembrane diffusion. In contrast, 1 hour after addition of either Dox-SA or Dox-CBD-SA, the cytoplasm did not show strong fluorescence compared to the unconjugated Dox. Rather, punctate fluorescence was observed, with some puncta colocalized with lysosomes, suggesting that Dox-SA and Dox-CBD-SA were both internalized via endocytosis. Twenty-four hours after the addition of Dox conjugates, we observed Dox-derived fluorescence in the nucleus as well, suggesting that the acidic pH in intracellular organelles induced drug liberation from the conjugates. We next examined the cytotoxicity of the different Dox forms in vitro. MMTV-PyMT cells or MC38 colon carcinoma cells were seeded and incubated in the presence of the Dox forms for 3 days. Viability tests showed that all three Dox forms have comparable cytotoxicity in vitro (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, G and H).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Dox-CBD-SA demonstrates comparable blood plasma pharmacokinetics as aldoxorubicin and accumulates in tumors</title><p>Aldoxorubicin reacts with endogenous SA rapidly after intravenous administration; therefore it possesses substantially longer blood plasma half-life compared with Dox (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>).

Conjugation with CBD-SA achieved the highest tumor accumulation of Dox after 24 hours of injection as well, showing a significant increase compared to aldoxorubicin. Histological analysis revealed that fluorescently labeled CBD-SA colocalized with CD31 staining within tumor tissue, demonstrating that CBD-SA targets the tumor vasculature (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).

Dox-CBD-SA, but not aldoxorubicin or Dox-SA, significantly increased the numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and NK cells within the tumor per unit tumor mass (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, G to I). In particular, Dox-CBD-SA treatment increased the number of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells more than twofold higher than the other treatment groups (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>). Plots of individual tumor size and TIL cell number revealed that Dox-CBD-SA indeed induced a correlation between small tumor size and the number of tumor-infiltrated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and NK cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, J to L).

Aldoxorubicin or Dox-CBD-SA was administered to mice 6, 9, and 12 days after tumor inoculation. Since Dox-CBD-SA increases the number of TILs, we injected 100 &#x003bc;g of &#x003b1;PD-1 1 day after Dox treatment two times (on days 10 and 13). Dox-CBD-SA + &#x003b1;PD-1 therapy completely eradicated established MC38 tumors (average tumor volume was about 100 mm<sup>3</sup> on day 6; <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, B and G) and significantly prolonged the survival of mice compared to all the other groups (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).

Nanoparticle-formulated (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>) or SA-reactive (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>) Dox exhibits improved pharmacokinetics and accumulation within tumors based in part on their pathologically abnormal vasculature (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>). However, this effect may not always be effective in human cancers because of their heterogeneity (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><italic>29</italic></xref>). Thus, drugs that are dependent on passive targeting alone may have room for improvement. Active targeting of tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigens for drug delivery is another therapeutic strategy. However, this intrinsically limits the applicable range of cancers and may also lead to acquired drug resistance due to antigen-selective cell targeting and killing, in which antigen may be lost by mutation (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><italic>30</italic></xref>). Here, we engineered CBD-SA to overcome these issues. Unlike other active targeting strategies, CBD-SA does not require the prior investigation of tumor-associated antigen expression because collagen is nearly ubiquitously expressed in tumors, and the CBD gains access to the tumor stroma via the abnormal blood vessel structure within the tumor microenvironment (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>). Subsequently, the CBD-SA binds to exposed collagen (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1C</xref> and 2D; fig. S2) and converts the tumor stroma into a reservoir for chemotherapeutics. Dox conjugation to CBD-SA showed significantly higher accumulation of Dox within tumor tissue compared to aldoxorubicin and Dox-SA (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). After accumulation of Dox-CBD-SA within the tumor tissue, the hydrazone linkage, which can be cleaved under the slightly acidic conditions in the tumor microenvironment (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>), enables the sustained release of Dox from CBD-SA. At the same time, it is known that tumor cells uptake SA (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Notably, CBD fusion did not alter the cellular uptake of SA (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), indicating that Dox-CBD-SA can also be delivered intracellularly as efficient as Dox-SA. Thus, part of the Dox release may occur in the tumor stroma, while the Dox-CBD-SA is still matrix-bound, and part may occur in the endolysosomal compartment following endocytosis. Incidentally, cancer stromal targeting (CAST) therapy using stroma-targeting antibodies has been proposed recently (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><italic>31</italic></xref>). The relatively low molecular mass of CBD-SA (88 kDa; fig. S1) may be a benefit compared to stroma-targeting antibodies in terms of diffusion into tumor tissues (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><italic>32</italic></xref>).</p><p>Regarding the payload of Dox, we conjugated about three Dox molecules per CBD-SA (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The drug-to-protein ratio of antibody-drug conjugates is typically close to 4 (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><italic>33</italic></xref>). Considering that CBD-SA is 59% of the molecular weight of an immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, CBD-SA at a ratio of 3 achieved a high payload of Dox compared to typical antibody-drug conjugates. In addition, SA fusion increases the solubility of the CBD, which is important for hydrophobic drugs (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>).</p><p>In terms of antitumor efficacy, Dox-CBD-SA significantly suppressed the growth of MMTV-PyMT breast cancer and extended the survival of mice compared to aldoxorubicin and Dox-SA (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A to F</xref>). Because Dox-CBD-SA showed the highest accumulation into tumor tissue in vivo, Dox-CBD-SA should induce tumor cell death more efficiently via inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. In addition to this effect, a single injection of Dox-CBD-SA brought a long-lasting therapeutic effect in spite of its faster plasma clearance half-life (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, A and B). This could be explained by our observation that Dox-CBD-SA treatment induces a higher number and density of TILs compared to Dox-SA and aldoxorubicin treatments (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, G to L</xref>). Therefore, the antitumor mechanism of action of Dox-CBD-SA may be not only direct cell killing but also the stimulation of host antitumor immunity. Since Dox-CBD-SA efficiently accumulates within tumors, it may induce ICD and tumor antigen exposure to the immune system more efficiently than aldoxorubicin and Dox-SA. As a consequence, Dox-CBD-SA synergistically eradicated MC38 colon carcinoma when administered in combination with &#x003b1;PD-1 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, B and G). Improved therapeutic efficacy of Dox-SA and Dox-CBD-SA in comparison with aldoxorubicin (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, A to F) also indicates that preconjugation of Dox before injection would provide higher antitumor efficacy. In addition to rapid clearance from blood circulation, in situ conjugation of aldoxorubicin with other sulfhydryl compounds such as cysteine, glutathione, fibronectin, or &#x003b1;1-antitrypsin in plasma (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>) is also a possible cause of inefficient therapeutic efficacy of aldoxorubicin.</p><p>Cardiac toxicity is a major drawback of Dox, which limits the lifetime cumulative dose of Dox (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>). Histological analysis revealed that even Dox-CBD-SA administration (20 mg/kg) did not show any signs of cardiac damage (fig. S9). This suggests that Dox preconjugated with CBD-SA is less cardiotoxic than free Dox, which irreversibly damages cardiac tissue at a cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg in mouse (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>). A cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg is nearly equivalent to the maximum cumulative dose in human (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>). We hypothesize that unconjugated Dox could penetrate into and damage cardiac tissue, whereas its preconjugated form would not penetrate into tissues or release Dox under physiological pH (i.e., within nonmalignant tissue or blood), contributing to reduced adverse events.</p><p>In terms of the manufacturing process, we conjugated Dox using Traut&#x02019;s reagent, which allows precise control of the drug conjugation ratio (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><italic>36</italic></xref>). This method has little risk to abrogate binding between the CBD and collagen since there are no lysine residues at the binding interface between the VWF A3 domain and collagen (fig. S5) (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>). Moreover, SA contains approximately sevenfold the number of lysine residues as the CBD sequence (table S1), also suggesting the low risk of unfavorable conformational changes in the CBD due to conjugation. Traut&#x02019;s reagent is also used for an ADC targeting CD70 (MDX-1203, Bristol-Myers Squibb) (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>), indicating its translational applicability. As CBD-SA is produced with high yield [human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell culture (~70 to 100 mg/liter)], we propose that preconjugation of Dox to CBD-SA produces high antitumor efficacy with a simple and translatable production method.</p><p>As a potential limitation, CBD-SA might accumulate in undesirable sites in the body such as liver, kidney, and wounds, where collagens may be exposed via a fenestrated or leaky endothelium, although Dox would not be released from the CBD-SA if such locations are at neutral pH. At least, we did not observe pathological damage in the liver and kidney after Dox-CBD-SA administration (20 mg/kg) (fig. S9). As another limitation, chemical conjugation may decrease the half-life of SA in general. Methotrexate conjugation reportedly accelerated the clearance of methotrexate-SA conjugates from circulation in a drug-to-protein ratio&#x02013;dependent manner (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><italic>38</italic></xref>). In this study, the half-lives of Dox-SA and Dox-CBD-SA were shorter than the reported half-life of native mouse SA [<italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub>, &#x003b2; = 35 (<italic>hours</italic>)] (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><italic>39</italic></xref>). The reason why aldoxorubicin showed a relatively longer half-life than Dox-SA conjugates is probably that it reacted with endogenous SA at a 1:1 ratio due to the abundance of SA in circulation.</p><p>In conclusion, Dox-CBD-SA accumulated into tumors and activated host antitumor immunity. As a consequence, monotherapy of Dox-CBD-SA suppressed orthotopic MMTV-PyMT breast tumor growth and prolonged survival. Combination therapy of Dox-CBD-SA with immune checkpoint inhibition via &#x003b1;PD-1 completely eradicated tumors in the immunogenic MC38 model. CBD fusion provided an active targeting ability to SA, which is classically used as a passively targeted drug carrier, enabling effective drug delivery to tumors from the systemic circulation. CBD-SA is expected to be nonimmunogenic and biologically acceptable because it is composed of two proteins (VWF A3 domain and SA) that naturally exist in the blood. Furthermore, CBD-SA acts independently of tumor type&#x02013;specific antigens and thus provides broad applicability to various types of solid tumors as a drug carrier. Therefore, CBD-SA may hold potential for clinical translation to cancer therapy as an antitumor drug carrier.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" disp-level="1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was designed to verify the strategy for anticancer drug delivery to tumors by engineered collagen-binding SA as a drug conjugation carrier.
