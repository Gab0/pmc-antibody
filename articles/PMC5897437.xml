However, there is little known about the selection and breadth of viral epitope-specific CD4 T cells that home to the lung after their initial priming. In this study, using a mouse model of influenza A infection and an unbiased method of epitope identification, the viral epitope-specific CD4 T cells elicited after infection were identified and quantified. We found that a very diverse specificity of CD4 T cells is primed by infection, including epitopes from hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, matrix protein, nucleoprotein, and non-structural protein-1. Using peptide-specific cytokine EliSpots, the diversity and immunodominance hierarchies established in the lung-draining lymph node were compared with specificities of CD4 T cells that home to the lung. Our studies revealed that CD4 T cells of all epitope specificities identified in peripheral lymphoid tissue home back to the lung and that most of these lung-homing cells are localized within the tissue rather than the pulmonary vasculature. There is a striking shift of CD4 T cell functionality that enriches for IFN-&#x003b3; production as cells are primed in the lymph node, enter the lung vasculature, and finally establish residency in the tissue, but with no apparent shifts in their functional avidity. We conclude that CD4 T cells of broad viral epitope specificity are recruited into the lung after influenza infection, where they then have the opportunity to encounter infected or antigen-bearing antigen-presenting cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CD4 T cells</kwd><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>lung</kwd><kwd>immunodominance</kwd><kwd>epitopes</kwd><kwd>antigen presenting cells</kwd><kwd>allophycoerythrin-conjugated</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000060</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn01">HHSN272201400006C, HHSN272201200005C</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="77"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="10929"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The fate and function of CD4 T cells elicited by infection with influenza virus, although extensively studied by many groups [reviewed in Ref. (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)], are still incompletely understood. It is clear that some cells remain in the draining lymph node (dLN) and participate in the germinal center response that is needed to elicit high affinity protective antibodies. CD4 T cells that remain in the dLN can also provide help to virus-specific CD8 T cells, promoting their expansion as effector cells as well as their establishment and maintenance as memory cells. Other subsets of virus-specific CD4 T cells enter the recirculating pool and can be detected in peripheral blood and in the spleen [reviewed in Ref. (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)]. Finally, a major subset of virus infection primed CD4 T cells traffic to the lung where they can convey a number of effector functions including production of anti-viral cytokines such as IFN-&#x003b3;, facilitation in the localization of infiltrating CD8 T cells in the airway (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), or direct cytotoxicity of antigen-bearing cells [reviewed in Ref. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)].</p><p>Coincident with the diverse functions of CD4 T cells in immunity to influenza is their very broad epitope specificity. Studies in our laboratory using several different mouse strains have indicated that influenza infection elicits a broad array of distinct epitope specificities (~20 to &#x0003e;60, depending on the mouse strain) that are derived from many different influenza proteins (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). One question that has not yet been addressed is whether these diverse peptide specificities that are elicited by infection persist in the CD4 T cells that home to the lung after infection. For the most part, CD4 T cell trafficking to the lung after influenza infection has been studied either by using T cell receptor (TcR) transgenic CD4 T cells (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) or other methods such as tetramer staining that tracks single epitope specificities (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) or by analyzing infiltrating CD4 T cells independently of their specificity (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>We speculated that there might be several mechanisms that could contribute to restricted epitope specificity in the lung during respiratory infection relative to the dLN where priming occurs. First, recent data (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) suggest that the &#x0201c;strength of signal&#x0201d; delivered through the TcR can determine CD4 T cell fate between follicular helper cells (Tfh) and other types of effector cells, leading to the possibility that epitope-specific preferences might emerge soon after priming in the dLN. In fact, our laboratory recently showed that divergence between Tfh and non-Tfh cells quantified in CD4 T cells isolated from the dLN at the peak of the response differs among distinct peptide epitopes. These epitope-dependent preferences in CD4 T cell differentiation persist independently of whether the epitopes are introduced <italic>via</italic> infection, protein vaccination, or in a completely heterologous protein vector (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Second, CD4 T cells that home to the lung after infection likely have the opportunity to interact with viral antigen bearing, class II positive antigen-presenting cells (APC) in the lung that are distinct from those in the lymph node (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Third, in the lung, glycoprotein viral antigen or influenza virion handling by lectin receptors (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) or viral antigen abundance could lead to distinct virus epitope display than that presented in the dLN. All of these events could affect CD4 T cell specificity, effector function, as well as selectivity of the repertoire established in the CD4 T cell memory pool.</p><p>Because of the importance of this issue, in this study, we sought to empirically examine the CD4 T cell peptide specificity, drawn from the endogenous, polyclonal CD4 T cell repertoire that homes to the lung after influenza infection. Using a mouse model of influenza A H1N1 infection and an unbiased method to identify CD4 T cell epitopes elicited by influenza infection, we compared the diversity of influenza-specific CD4 T cells and immunodominance hierarchies within the lung with that established in the priming lymph node. We also examined the distribution of CD4 T cells within pulmonary vasculature and lung tissue and their cytokine potential and the avidity of their T cell receptors. Our studies revealed that most of the antigen-specific pulmonary CD4 T cells are localized to the tissue as compared to the vasculature and that the extensive degree of epitope-specific diversity observed in the dLN is maintained in the lung after infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Mice</title><p>A/JCr female mice were purchased from Charles River laboratories and were maintained in the specific pathogen-free facility at the University of Rochester according to the institutional guidelines.

A peptide pooling matrix (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), in conjunction with splenic CD4 T cells isolated day 9&#x02013;11 postinfection, were employed in order to define the epitope specificity of CD4 T cells elicited by influenza A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) virus, as we have previously described (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This method, involving cytokine EliSpot assays and overlapping peptide libraries encompassing the entire translated sequence of pathogen-derived proteins, allows an unbiased approach to identify CD4 T cells epitopes. CD4 T cells specific for five distinct viral proteins, hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), nucleoprotein (NP), matrix 1 (M1), and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) were chosen for these studies (See Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These viral proteins are abundantly expressed after infection and have distinct sites of localization in the virion and infected cells. Thus, these viral proteins might be handled differently <italic>in vivo</italic> after infection. HA and NA are transmembrane glycoproteins, M1 is associated with the cytosolic/inner membrane of infected cells/virions respectively, NP is abundant in viral ribonuclear protein complexes infected cells and virions, while NS1 is absent in virions, but is abundantly produced in infected cells and can be found in the cytosol and nucleus in infected cells (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows the results of replicate cytokine EliSpot assays, using IL-2 (Panel A) and IFN-&#x003b3; (Panel B) to quantify peptide-reactive cells for the epitopes previously identified, including as many as is feasible, from many different influenza viral proteins. It is clear from these analyses that the epitope specificity of CD4 T cells is very broad and that CD4 T cells specific for immunodominant epitopes from HA, NP and NA could be readily identified, as well as subdominant and more minor epitope specificities from M1 and NS1. Although early studies suggested that NP and HA were the major source of epitopes recognized by CD4 T cells after infection (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), more recent studies by our laboratory have demonstrated that epitope specificity can be quite broad and depends on the selectivity imposed by MHC class II molecules (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).

Early studies by Woodland <italic>et al</italic>.&#x02009;(<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) showed that a CD4 T cell repertoire with diverse epitope specificity can be detected in the lung after infection. In the experiments here, we sought to perform side-by-side analyses of CD4 T cells present at the peak of the response in the lymph node with those cells that had migrated to the lung. The peptides validated by replicate assays shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> were used to sample CD4 T cells from the lung-draining mLN and lung at days 9&#x02013;11 after infection. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the results of these analyses, where mLN responses are shown in Panel A and lung-specific responses are shown Panel B. IL-2 (blue bars) and IFN-&#x003b3; (green bars) producing cells were both sampled in peptide-stimulated cytokine EliSpots assays. It is clear from this side-by-side analysis that the CD4 T cell specificities primed in the lung-dLN can be readily detected in the lung. Both IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3; producers are detectable in the lung, although there is a striking shift in cytokine profile, with IFN-&#x003b3; producing cells becoming much more prominently represented in CD4 T cells isolated from the lung relative to those from the LN (note the differences in scales used for cytokine producing cells in LN and lung). Even the minor epitope specificities, such those derived from NS1 and M1, are readily detectable in the lung. Thus, the broad peptide specificity in CD4 T cells primed in the lymph node persists in CD4 T cells isolated from the lung. We noted no striking gains or losses of CD4 T cell specificity when the dLN and lung are compared. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> illustrates the diversity in lung homing CD4 T cells in a readily visualized manner using a pie diagram. Here, every peptide specificity that was tested is denoted by a different color with the width of the pie &#x0201c;slice&#x0201d; indicating the relative abundance of the epitope specificity, using either IL-2 or IFN-&#x003b3; EliSpots as an indicator of the magnitude of the response to each peptide. The protein derivation of each of the peptides sampled is indicated by the outer arc in these diagrams. These studies show that each peptide specificity detected in the LN is represented in the lung independently of its protein origin. It is clear that our estimate of the immunodominance hierarchy is dependent on cytokine production by the virus-specific CD4 T cells. Alternative measures, such as tetramer staining, potentially detect of CD4 T cells that do not produce cytokine but are limited by their ability to detect only high affinity CD4 T cells, perhaps encompassing only 5&#x02013;30% of the total antigen-specific CD4 T cell repertoire (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Broad CD4 T cell specificity identified in the draining lymph node (dLN) is maintained at the site of infection.

However, it is now understood that lung-localized lymphocytes can be situated into two discrete sites following infection: the vasculature and the tissue, the latter of which includes parenchyma, interstitium, and the airways (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). We considered the possibility that the virus-specific CD4 T cells that were extracted from the lung and quantified by peptide-induced cytokine EliSpots were localized to the vasculature and thus had not yet encountered pulmonary APC. Cells within the lung vasculature and the tissue can be distinguished by the accessibility to antibodies that are introduced into the bloodstream shortly before animal euthanasia (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Using this method, cells in the lung vasculature become labeled, whereas cells in the tissue are &#x0201c;protected&#x0201d; from this short-term introduction of antibody. To evaluate the location of the cytokine-producing cells quantified in the previous experiments, A/J mice infected 10&#x02009;days previously were injected IV with an allophycoerythrin-conjugated (fAPC)-CD45 antibody that would label all hematopoietic cells. Mice were sacrificed 3&#x02009;min later and lung homogenates were prepared, and the resulting cell population was analyzed by flow cytometry. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A (top panel) shows that 100% of the peripheral blood CD4 T cells stained positive directly <italic>ex vivo</italic>, assuring us that the IV-introduced CD45 was sufficient to saturate circulating cells. Within the cells isolated from the lung (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A, bottom panel) approximately 40% of the total CD4 T cells were accessible to the IV antibody (pseudocolored in red in this and future data sets), while a substantial proportion (60%) of the CD4 T cells were protected from labeling (pseudocolored in blue). We next evaluated the phenotype of the CD4 T cells distinguished by CD45 staining, using the markers associated with antigen experience (CD44) and with those associated with tissue residence [CD69 and CD11a (LFA-1)] (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B shows that the CD4 T cells in the vasculature were primarily composed of na&#x000ef;ve cells, whereas cells in the protected tissue were greatly enriched for antigen experienced, CD44<sup>hi</sup> cells. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C shows a characterization of cells for the markers CD11a and CD69. The integrin CD11a, important in T cell activation and for extravasation into tissue sites, has been shown to have increased cell surface density on tissue-localized cells, while CD69, a prototypical marker of tissue-resident T cells is known to enhance tissue localization in part through its reciprocal antagonism of the sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>C shows the co-expression of these markers on CD44<sup>hi</sup> cells in the vasculature (in red) vs. the protected tissue (in blue). Among the CD44 bright cells, CD4 T cells in the tissue show increased cell surface density of CD11a (MFI&#x02009;=&#x02009;11,000) compared to vascular localized (MFI&#x02009;=&#x02009;7,000) and are greatly enriched for CD69 expression (76% vs. 21%, respectively). The data from individual animals, shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D, illustrate the reproducibility in the markers expressed on these distinct lung subsets. We conclude from these data that the IV labeling successfully distinguished CD4 T cells in the lung vasculature vs. the lung tissue, and that in this system, IV-protected cells have the markers associated with residence in the inflammatory microenvironment in the lung and thus the potential to contact a diverse set of lung-localized APC within the infected lung. However, this selective lung homing behavior and residency does not appear to restrict epitope specificity.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Intravenously (IV) labeling reveals distinct compartmentalization and phenotype of pulmonary CD4 T cells following infection. <bold>(A)</bold> Representative IV CD45-fAPC staining profile from pre-gated, CD4+&#x02009;T cells in blood and lung following infection, where blue denotes &#x0201c;protected&#x0201d; cells and red denotes &#x0201c;labeled&#x0201d; cells. <bold>(B)</bold> Contour plots (CD4 <italic>vs</italic>.

The results from these analyses indicated that 92&#x02013;94% of the virus-specific IFN-&#x003b3; production was produced by cells in the lung tissue, while 86&#x02013;90% of the IL-2 producing cells were within the lung tissue. There was no notable difference in the distribution of cytokine-producing cells specific for different viral proteins. We conclude from these analyses that the vast majority of cells assayed by cytokine EliSpots were from CD4 T cells that had entered the lung tissue and do not simply represent circulating CD4 T cells trapped in the lung vasculature. These infiltrating, virus-specific CD4 T cells thus had an opportunity to survey any viral peptide-bearing APC within the tissue.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Virus-specific, cytokine-producing CD4 T cells are enriched in &#x0201c;protected&#x0201d; niches in the lung following influenza virus infection.

CD4 T cells specific for each protein-specific pool of peptides were quantified for IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3; and co-cytokine production by sequential gating strategies. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A shows the cytokine polyfunctionality in the dLN, where the cells are distributed almost equally between cells that produce only one cytokine: IL-2 only (turquoise), IFN-&#x003b3; only (orange) and cells that produce both cytokines IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>, IL-2<sup>+</sup> (yellow). When the cells in the vasculature are analyzed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>B), there is an apparent commitment of lung homing cells to a Th1 IFN-&#x003b3; producing population, with only a minor fraction of cells that exclusively produce IL-2. In the lung tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C), the virus-specific cells are comprised primarily of IFN-&#x003b3; producing cells, with most of the CD4 T cells producing only IFN-&#x003b3; and very few cells producing only IL-2. Thus, there appears to be a readily detectable and progressive enrichment of cells toward IFN-&#x003b3; producers from the site of CD4 T cell priming in the dLN, to when the cells traffic <italic>via</italic> circulation to the lung vasculature and finally establish residency in the lung tissue. All viral protein specificities appear to progress from the most diverse in cytokine potential within the lymph node, toward the most restricted cytokine-producing cells within the lung tissue. The vasculature-localized cells are intermediate between these extremes, containing some virus-specific cells producing only IL-2, a phenotype that is very poorly represented in the lung tissue. Overall, these data are consistent with the priming of CD4 T cells with diverse functional potential and for selection of a subset of these virus-specific CD4 T cells, enriched for IFN-&#x003b3; potential for traffic to the lung after influenza infection.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Cytokine pattern of virus-specific CD4 T cells is distinct in lymph node and lung.

There has been a number of recent studies suggesting that TcR signal strength, largely determined by the affinity and/or off rate of the TcR to its ligand, can influence the fate of CD4 T cells after priming (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). We sought to assess the functional avidity of virus-specific CD4 T cells isolated from lung vs. the dLN at the peak of the adaptive response, independently of any potential differences in signaling capacity or expression of co-stimulatory molecules, which can affect sensitivity to antigen or cytokine responses (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Therefore, we established virus-specific CD4 T cell hybridomas. CD4 T cells isolated from the draining LN and lung were restimulated with antigenic peptides, and then T cell blasts were fused to the TcR-negative T cell lymphoma BW5147. Using the TcR negative BW5147 cell line as the fusion partner, the only source of T cell receptors are those expressed by the CD4 T cells from the individual cell which has entered into a fusion with the BW5147, thus allowing us to directly query the receptors expressed on the CD4 T cells from the host (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). After selection, CD4 T cell hybridomas were derived and identified. This immortalization allows the T cell receptors to now be expressed on a &#x0201c;neutral&#x0201d; cellular background, allowing more objective comparative analyses of their relative avidity for antigen, thus will exclude the properties of freshly isolated CD4 T cells whose differentiation state or expression of co-stimulatory molecules can affect sensitivity to antigen.</p><p>The functional avidity of isolated T cell hybridoma clones that express distinct TcR V beta segments for two dominant epitopes were then compared using peptide dose-response curves, where TcR engagement was quantified by IL-2 production, which is the cytokine routinely used to assay T cell hybridomas. We (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) and others (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) have shown that hybridoma cells provide a very sensitive measure of functional TcR avidity. The results of these experiments are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. Individual clones of CD4 T cell hybridomas specific for NA446 (left) or NP127 (right) from each tissue were tested in peptide dose-response assays, and IL-2 was quantified using CTLL, an IL-2 dependent cell line. The peptide dose-response curves are shown from the hybridomas isolated from dLN (in red) or from lung (in black) are shown the top panels, with the average values shown in the bottom panels. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> provides that half maximal dose of peptide needed to activate the individual clones. This variability in functional avidity, as well as our studies indicating that many clones express distinct TcR Vbeta segments (not shown), indicates that the clones of hybridomas are not replicates of each other. Although there were notable differences in sensitivity to antigenic peptide by the individual CD4 T cell hybridomas, the ranges in &#x0201c;functional avidity&#x0201d; between CD4 T cells derived from dLN and lung were indistinguishable. We conclude from this that the CD4 T cell repertoire of T cells that home to the lung is not dramatically remodeled with regard to the functional avidities of the CD4 T cells isolated from the lung dLN.</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Similar range in functional TcR avidity from CD4 T cells isolated from dLN and lung.

(<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>)]. In some systems, lung-homing CD4 T cells can also help in tissue-localized B cell responses (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). In this study, we have evaluated whether the diverse CD4 T cell epitope specificity that is elicited in the lung dLN after influenza infection persists in the CD4 T cells that home to the lung. We were interested in this issue because recent data suggest that CD4 T cell fate can be influenced by the specific features of the peptide:class II-T cell receptor complex (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). These recent studies, coupled with our increasing appreciation of the multiplicity of functions that CD4 T cells carry out in the lung (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) and the distinctive antigen bearing cells within the lung after infection (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), raised the possibility that the CD4 T cell immunodominance hierarchy established in the dLN after infection might be remodeled as CD4 T cells are selected for lung homing during priming or alternatively, after establishment of residency in the lung tissue. Our studies revealed that when assayed by epitope-specific cytokine production, the epitope specificity of influenza-specific CD4 T cells is very broad in the dLN and that this diverse peptide specificity persists in cells that home to the lung. Also, the immunodominance hierarchies established in the dLN are maintained in lung CD4 T cells.</p><p>The factors that control CD4 T cell homing to the lung after influenza infection are not well defined. Recent studies have implicated upregulation of chemokine receptors such as CXCR3 (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) and CCR4 (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>) during priming as an important event in homing and establishing residency in the lung after respiratory pathogen infection. Upregulation of chemokine receptors such as CXCR3 has been observed with Th1 priming in the lymph node after infection with some respiratory pathogens (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>) and has been suggested to play a role into recruitment in the lung after intranasal infection or vaccination (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). In the infection model studied here, we also observed a strong enrichment for IFN-&#x003b3;-producing cells in the lung, for all epitopes examined, a result consistent with the Th1 CD4 T cell phenotype typical of influenza CD4 T cell immunity. Enrichment for IFN-&#x003b3; in the cells that traffic to the lung suggests that the early priming events in the dLN delivered signals to the elicited CD4 T cells that promoted lung homing and IFN-&#x003b3; production, features that appear to be functionally linked in most respiratory virus responses. The nature of the APC that are involved in initial of priming CD4 T cells in responses to infection or vaccination is not well understood, but may involve multiple subsets contacted sequentially (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). The expression of co-factors that control trafficking of MHC class II, proteolysis of antigen, and editing of the final displayed epitopes on different APC (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>) have not been characterized in responses to respiratory infection. If there are specialized APC that promote homing of the responding CD4 T cells to the lung, our data suggest that these APC present the full diversity of virus-derived peptides, permitting all of the CD4 T cell specificities primed to be included in the subset of CD4 T cells destined for the lung. As of yet, there is little known about the TcR-mediated signaling events that might preferentially poise cells during priming of the na&#x000ef;ve CD4 T cell repertoire to be selected to the CXCR3/Th1 pathway of differentiation that determines lung homing potential. Recent studies suggest that choices in the fate of CD4 T cells after priming (e.g., Tfh <italic>vs</italic>. non-Tfh &#x0201c;effector cells&#x0201d;) can be strongly influenced by specific features of peptide:class II-TcR complexes described by their &#x0201c;signal strength&#x0201d; or functional avidity [reviewed in Ref. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)]. However, the data accumulated thus far have sometimes been contradictory and, in any case, have not yet analyzed the priming events or APC that poise CD4 T cells elicited by respiratory infection to leave the dLN and migrate to the lung. The paucity of information is particularly notable for polyclonal CD4 T cells drawn from the endogenous response. In the studies reported here, when the TcR repertoire for CD4 T cells specific for two dominant influenza epitopes isolated from dLN and lung were examined here for &#x0201c;functional avidity&#x0201d; using peptide dose&#x02013;response curves, although there were a range in sensitivity to antigenic peptides among individual clones, the range in the avidities was indistinguishable within CD4 T cells isolated from the two compartments, suggesting that CD4 cells selected for homing to the tissue were not atypical with regard to affinity from the range elicited during priming and that persist in the dLN at day 10&#x02013;11 postinfection. Although it would be of interest to study the CD4 T cell repertoire at later time points, as immune memory is established, several factors preclude analyses of this for the purposes of this study. First, in a comprehensive survey of the immunodominance in CD4 T cell responses to influenza using the HLA-DR1 mouse strain, we found that the abundance of total influenza reactive CD4 T cells in the periphery at memory time points (e.g., day 30&#x02013;60 postinfection) diminished to 5% of the levels detected at the peak of the response (day 8&#x02013;10 postinfection). In this earlier study, we tracked more than 50 different influenza epitopes. Remarkably, although much lower in abundance, the CD4 T cell immunodominance hierarchy was stable (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). For the current study, when we have examined the abundance and distribution of CD4 T cells at an even modestly extended time (day 18 postinfection), the number of antigen-experienced CD4 T cells in the lung drops dramatically, to less than 15% of that seen at the peak. Even more important, using the IV labeling technique, we found that the total lung CD4 T cells are now composed equally of vasculature and tissue localized cells (data not shown). Because in the current study, we explicitly sought to examine cells within the unique microenvironment of the lung tissue after infection, analyzing CD4 T cell specificity at even just a few additional weeks postinfection would be complicated by the very large representation of CD4 cells from the lung vasculature.</p><p>The persistence in broad immunodominance, with little skewing or narrowing of specificity or functional avidity, raised the possibility that the cells detected from disrupted lung tissue were contained within the vasculature and had not yet entered the infected lung and contacted lung APC. However, our studies revealed that most of the cytokine-producing cells within the lung were within the lung tissue, rather than the vasculature, suggesting that the infiltrating cells likely have had the opportunity to encounter potential antigen bearing cells in the lung. There have been several recent studies that have suggested that viral antigens persist long after virus is cleared from the lungs (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Early studies included the demonstration that viral peptide:MHC class II complexes at levels sufficient to activate adoptively transferred CD4 T cells persist in the lung draining LN for at least 60&#x02009;days postinfection (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). More recent studies indicated that viral RNA and viral protein can be detected primarily in radio-resistant non-hematopoietic cells in the lung tissue for more than 2&#x02009;weeks after virus is cleared from the lung (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Finally, contact of infiltrating T cells with lung APC after infection has been supported by recent reports in the literature (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>).</p><p>Whether influenza viral antigens are accessible in the form of peptide:class II complexes to infiltrating CD4 T cells and persists as the adaptive response progresses in the infection model studied here is not known. For influenza-specific MHC class I restricted T cells, Legge and coworkers provided evidence that recruited dendritic cells that persist in the lung serve as APC for newly primed infiltrating virus-specific CD8 T cells (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Recent studies by Swain <italic>et al</italic>.&#x02009;of CD4 T cells primed in influenza infection suggest that late (e.g., day 5&#x02013;7 postinfection) contact with antigen bearing cells is important in establishing long lived virus-specific CD4 T cell memory. In this study, tracking of epitope-specific cells and use of reporters that detect TcR engagement suggested that these later (day 5&#x02013;7 postinfection) antigen-dependent interactions occur in the lung (<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Collectively, these studies suggest that influenza-specific CD4 T cells that home to the lung after infection can encounter peptide:MHC class II complexes and such contact might affect survival and potential remodeling of the immunodominance hierarchy. Our recent studies performed early after infection with a Venus reporter virus suggests that a diverse array of both bone marrow derived and non-bone marrow derived, class II positive cells acquire viral proteins during infection and that many of these subsets express detectable viral peptide:class II complex (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, the anatomic distribution and persistence of these diverse antigen-bearing APC are not known at this time, nor their options for encounter with lung-infiltrating CD4 T cells after primary infection. We have not yet quantified the epitope display on MHC class II positive cells in the lung at later time points when CD4 T cells begin to infiltrate the lung (day 5&#x02013;6 postinfection) or the presence long lived antigen depots in this infection system. Thus, we do not yet know whether the lung homing CD4 T cells identified here have contacted epitope-bearing APC in the lung. If APC-CD4 T cell antigen dependent contact has occurred, it seems not to have resulted in detectable remodeling of CD4 T cell repertoire that is established in the dLN. Despite these limitations in our studies thus far, the data presented here provide new insight into tissue-specific homing after influenza infection and demonstrate that CD4 T cells of broad viral epitope specificity elicited after H1N1 influenza infection are recruited into the lung, where they then have the opportunity to encounter infected and/or antigen bearing APC and deliver effector function.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the University of Rochester Medical Center.
