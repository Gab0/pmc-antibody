DNGR-1 senses necrosis and regulates CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell cross-priming to dead-cell-associated antigens. In addition, DNGR-1 is a target for selective <italic>in vivo</italic> delivery of antigens to DC and the induction of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell and Ab responses. In this study, we evaluated whether DNGR-1 targeting can be additionally used to manipulate antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes. Injection of small amounts of antigen-coupled anti-DNGR-1 mAb into mice promoted MHC class II antigen presentation selectively by CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC. In the steady state, this was sufficient to induce proliferation of antigen-specific na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and to drive their differentiation into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory lymphocytes. Co-administration of adjuvants prevented this induction of tolerance and promoted immunity. Notably, distinct adjuvants allowed qualitative modulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell behavior: poly I:C induced a strong IL-12-independent Th1 response, whereas curdlan led to the priming of Th17 cells. Thus, antigen targeting to DNGR-1 is a versatile approach for inducing functionally distinct CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. Given the restricted pattern of expression of DNGR-1 across species, this strategy could prove useful for developing immunotherapy protocols in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Antigen targeting</kwd><kwd>CLEC9A</kwd><kwd>DC NK lectin group receptor-1</kwd><kwd>Immunity</kwd><kwd>Tolerance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type=""><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulating the T-cell compartment is the principal function of DC and therefore, manipulation of DC offers great promise for immune intervention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Numerous studies have focused on the therapeutic potential of <italic>ex-vivo-</italic>generated DC that are subsequently infused into patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. An alternative approach consists of Ab-mediated targeting of antigens to endocytic receptors expressed by DC <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In mice, this method can elicit powerful cellular and humoral responses, beneficial in models of cancer or infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Conversely, it can also lead to antigen-specific tolerance, useful for limiting autoimmune diseases or allograft rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Whether antigen targeting to DC results in tolerance or immunity depends on the nature of the targeting Ab, antigen dose, co-administered adjuvants, immunological readout used to measure response, and importantly, the receptor used for targeting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Ideally, the latter should be restricted in expression to DC to allow for focused antigen delivery, and should additionally be capable of mediating endocytosis of bound Ab&#x02013;antigen conjugates and delivering these to antigen processing pathways. In addition, a versatile receptor for antigen targeting should be &#x0201c;neutral&#x0201d; in that its targeting by antibodies should not result in overwhelming delivery of signals that instruct DC to prime particular types of immune responses. Antigen targeting to such &#x0201c;neutral&#x0201d; receptors can then be combined with defined immunomodulators to favor specific immune outcomes, ranging from immunological tolerance to different kinds of immunity.</p><p>DC comprise multiple subsets that may be specialized to perform distinct and, sometimes, opposing functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Thus, another consideration in targeting approaches is whether it might be preferable to direct antigens to a single DC subset or to multiple subtypes. Of the large panel of endocytic surface molecules tested as targeting receptors to date, many are expressed by multiple DC subsets and by other populations of hematopoietic and/or non-hematopoietic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In search for receptors restricted in expression to specific DC subsets, we identified a novel endocytic C-type lectin receptor that we named <italic>DC NK lectin group receptor-1</italic> (DNGR-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In mice, DNGR-1 (also known as CLEC9A) is expressed at high level by the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> subset and at low level by plasmacytoid DC (pDC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In our studies, mouse DNGR-1 was not detected on other leukocytes, although others have reported low levels of expression on a subset of B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Interestingly, DNGR-1 expression is also very restricted to DC in human PBMC as it is detected almost exclusively on lineage-negative BDCA-3<sup>+</sup> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, a subtype of DC proposed to constitute the functionally equivalent of the mouse CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. DNGR-1 binds to an unidentified ligand(s) exposed in necrotic cells and is involved in crosspresentation of dead-cell-associated antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In line with this role, we found that antigens targeted to mouse DNGR-1 <italic>via</italic> antibodies were efficiently crosspresented by CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Notably, when given with adjuvants, anti-DNGR-1 antigen conjugates induce effective CTL responses that protect mice from tumor challenge in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>It has recently been shown by Caminschi <italic>et al.</italic> that antigen targeting to DNGR-1 can additionally promote MHC class II presentation and T-cell-dependent Ab production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In contrast to CTL priming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, the Ab responses seen did not require co-administration of adjuvant, suggesting that DNGR-1 targeting to DC might generate intrinsic signals that favor CD4<sup>+</sup> but not CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell priming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In this study, we confirm that antigens targeted to DNGR-1 in the steady state can be presented on MHC class II molecules, and we show that this presentation is restricted to CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC. However, we find that, in the absence of adjuvant, Ab responses are weak and show that this form of antigen targeting does not inevitably lead to CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell priming but, rather, can be used to favor the conversion of antigen-specific na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> suppressive cells. In contrast, in the presence of adjuvants, the same targeting approach promotes the development of potent Ab and Th1 or Th17 CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. Thus, DNGR-1 acts predominantly as a &#x0201c;neutral&#x0201d; receptor, and antigen targeting to this receptor combined with appropriate immunomodulators can be used to promote a wide range of responses, from dominant tolerance to qualitatively distinct types of immunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Results</title><sec><title>Anti-DNGR-1 mAb selectively and rapidly targets CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> and pDC in mice</title><p>To mark DNGR-1<sup>+</sup> cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, mice were injected i.v. with fluorophore-labeled anti-DNGR-1 or isotype-matched control mAb.

Systemic inflammation induced by LPS administration did not change the pattern of targeting by anti-DNGR-1 mAb (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. 2</xref>).

Thus, antigen targeting to CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC using anti-DNGR-1 mAb in the absence of adjuvant leads to rapid but short-lived antigen presentation on MHC class II molecules.</p><p>To monitor presentation directly <italic>in vivo</italic>, we transferred CFSE-labeled OT-II cells and 1 day later, we injected the mice with 0.5 &#x003bc;g of OVA<sub>323&#x02013;339</sub>-coupled anti-DNGR-1 mAb, 5 &#x003bc;g of OVA<sub>323&#x02013;339</sub>-coupled isotype-matched control, 20 &#x003bc;g of OVA (in the form of egg white <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>; OVAegg) or 1 &#x003bc;g of OVA<sub>323&#x02013;339</sub> peptide.

To avoid any contribution from memory or Treg, we transferred sorted na&#x000ef;ve OT-II lymphocytes into B6 mice.

However, the anti-rat IgG response seen with anti-DNGR-1 alone was dwarfed by that which could be induced by co-administration of poly I:C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3C</xref>). Poly I:C additionally led to increased expression of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules on CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC (not shown) and strongly boosted the expansion of OT-II cells induced by the Ab&#x02013;antigen complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B, D, E</xref>).

Ab-mediated delivery of antigenic epitopes to DC has variably been shown to allow priming of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell immunity or to induce tolerance through deletion or conversion of antigen-specific T cell into Treg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. An ideal target should be a surface receptor that delivers the targeting Ab to endocytic and cytosolic compartments for processing of the linked antigenic moiety and subsequent (cross)presentation by MHC class I and/or class II molecules. In addition, it might be desirable to target a &#x0201c;neutral&#x0201d; receptor, <italic>i.e.</italic> one that does not activate DC upon Ab binding, in order to be able to induce tolerance or to tune immunity by co-administering specific immunomodulators. Finally, the target receptor should be restricted to DC, in particular to DC subsets with proved capacity for antigen presentation to T cells. In this study, we show that DNGR-1 fits all of these criteria. DNGR-1-targeted antigens are presented to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells selectively by CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC without promoting strong Th-cell priming. Adjuvants can be co-administered to selectively induce Th1 or Th17 responses. In addition, small amounts of DNGR-1-targeted antigen in the absence of adjuvant can be used to delete antigen-specific T cells and promote Treg conversion.</p><p>Although CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC have been suggested to be less efficient in MHC class II antigen presentation than other DC subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, this study and many others demonstrate that they are able to present antigens to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. They also excel in antigen crosspresentation to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and, therefore, can concomitantly present antigen to both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, allowing optimal delivery of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell help for CTL priming. In addition, as shown here, CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC can drive the differentiation of Th1 or Th17 cells depending on the adjuvant. Although the ability of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC to trigger a Th1 response is well documented, this is the first instance when these cells have been shown to induce Th17 differentiation. These data therefore indicate that CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC are not ontogenetically pre-programmed to induce Th1 responses and highlight the previously noted importance of innate signals in regulating DC subset function and instruction of adaptive immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. They further suggest that CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC are attractive targets for a wide range of vaccination approaches designed to promote immunity to distinct challenges. Interestingly, CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC can produce large amounts of TGF-&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. This finding may explain their ability to induce Th17 responses in an inflammatory setting and fits with our previous finding of TGF-&#x003b2;-dependent induction of Th17 cells by curdlan-stimulated DC <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In addition, TGF-&#x003b2; acts to promote the conversion of na&#x000ef;ve T cells into antigen-specific Treg in non-inflammatory conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. This can be seen with small amounts of DNGR-1-targeted antigen in the absence of adjuvant, in agreement with previous conclusions that antigen presentation in sub-immunogenic conditions promotes establishment of tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Notably, the CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC population includes cells able to synthesize retinoic acid, which enhances Treg conversion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. It is intriguing to speculate that such cells might be responsible for Treg conversion following antigen targeting to DNGR-1. The fact that high doses of antigen and/or strong activation of DC limit Treg accumulation can be explained by the antagonistic effect of T-cell proliferation on the Treg conversion process, as previously reported by Kretschmer <italic>et al</italic>. upon antigen delivery using anti-DEC205 mAb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>Tolerance induction by antigen targeting to DNGR-1 could be useful in clinical settings for inducing transplantation tolerance or controlling autoimmunity and could be improved, for example, by co-administering immunomodulatory molecules, such as IL-2 and rapamycin, which expand freshly generated Treg while selectively dampening down the &#x0201c;effector&#x0201d; population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. It is worth noting that in contrast to the induction of Th1, Th17 or Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells, we cannot induce the differentiation of Th2 cells. This result is in line with the notion that CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC are poor Th2 inducers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> and fits with recent publications showing that antigen presentation by DC is not involved in driving Th2 responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Thus, vaccines or immunotherapies employing antigen targeting to DNGR-1 are unlikely to inadvertently drive a detrimental allergic Th2 response.</p><p>We can promote Th1 differentiation with CpG and anti-CD40 mAb but find that poly I:C is by far the most potent inducer of Th1 priming, in agreement with a recent publication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Notably, double-stranded RNA, such as poly I:C, triggers IL-12 production in DC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>, but it has been reported that IL-12 is dispensable for Th1 priming when antigen is selectively targeted to CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Our finding that anti-DNGR-1 conjugates plus poly I:C prime normal Th1 responses in IL-12 p40-deficient animals is consistent with that report.</p><p>Antigen targeting to some DC-expressed C-type lectin receptor has been reported to trigger CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell help-dependent B-cell responses in the absence of adjuvant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In line with these observations, Caminschi <italic>et al</italic>. recently showed that a single administration of anti-DNGR-1 rat mAb could trigger anti-rat IgG production, and when the mAb was coupled to OVA protein, proliferation of OVA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and an anti-OVA IgG response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In their setting, the co-injection of LPS did not boost Ab production and the fact that the humoral response had undergone isotype switching was taken as evidence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell priming, which was confirmed by using T-cell-deficient mice. When targeting small amounts of antigen to DNGR-1 in the absence of adjuvant, we are unable to induce immunity as assessed by antigen-specific Th1, Th2 or Th17 differentiation or an anti-rat IgG response. Instead, we found that antigen targeting to DNGR-1 in the steady state, if anything, leads to Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T-cell differentiation. This observation is consistent with the fact that our anti-DNGR-1 antibodies, like those of Caminschi <italic>et al.</italic>, are unable to trigger detectable phenotypic or functional maturation of CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC, thought to be a prerequisite for immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. With our reagents, inducing an anti-rat IgG response in the absence of adjuvant was only possible when high amounts of antigen were injected. But even when pushing the system in that manner, the response remained 2&#x02013;3 orders of magnitude lower than the one induced in the presence of poly I:C. These data suggest that antigen targeting to DNGR-1 in the absence of adjuvant might lead to Ab production in certain conditions but that the process is inefficient and that DC activation by a potent adjuvant remains important for triggering of a strong humoral response. Thus, our data largely agree with those of Caminschi <italic>et al.</italic> and any differences might be quantitative and reflect the use of distinct targeting antibodies, possibly bearing different affinities for DNGR-1. The major difference between the two studies is the fact that Caminschi <italic>et al.</italic> found that the inclusion of adjuvant did not substantially boost Ab titers, whereas in our case, we see a massive increase. This discrepancy might be explained by the fact that Caminschi <italic>et al.</italic> used LPS, which is a poor adjuvant in comparison with poly I:C for antigen targeting approaches in which CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC are the dominant APC (data not shown and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p>It has recently been proposed that human blood lineage-negative HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> BDCA-3<sup>+</sup> cells may encompass functional equivalents of mouse CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. A genome-wide analysis of the transcriptome of different populations of mouse and human leukocytes supports this contention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. If BDCA-3<sup>+</sup> DC prove to have similar properties to the mouse CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC population, those cells could become attractive targets for immune manipulation. In mice, targeting to DEC205 has been considered as the &#x0201c;canonical&#x0201d; way to direct antigens to CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> DC. However, there is no evidence that this lectin is expressed on BDCA-3<sup>+</sup> DC and additionally human DEC205 has been detected on a large spectrum of hematopoietic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Given its highly restricted pattern of expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, its ability to promote MHC class I crosspresentation and the present demonstration that DNGR-1 targeting can be useful for manipulation of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment, we envisage that DNGR-1 could constitute a useful target to selectively deliver antigens to BDCA-3<sup>+</sup> DC and, by extension, for antigen targeting approaches in human.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 (B6), B6.SJL, OT-II, OT-II B6.SJL and <italic>clec9a<sup>egfp/egfp</sup></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> mice were bred at Cancer Research UK in specific pathogen-free conditions.
