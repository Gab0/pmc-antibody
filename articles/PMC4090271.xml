Despite improved clinical outcomes, current CLL therapies are not curative. Therefore, antibodies with greater efficacy and novel targets are desirable. One promising target is CD37, a tetraspanin protein highly expressed on malignant B-cells in CLL and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. While several novel CD37-directed therapeutics are emerging, detailed preclinical evaluation of these agents is limited by lack of appropriate animal models with spontaneous leukemia expressing the human CD37 (hCD37) target. To address this, we generated a murine CLL model that develops transplantable hCD37+ leukemia. Subsequently, we engrafted healthy mice with this leukemia to evaluate IMGN529, a novel hCD37-targeting antibody-drug conjugate. IMGN529 rapidly eliminated peripheral blood leukemia and improved overall survival. In contrast, the antibody component of IMGN529 could not alter disease course despite exhibiting substantial <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity. Furthermore, IMGN529 is directly cytotoxic to human CLL <italic>in vitro</italic>, depletes B-cells in patient whole blood, and promotes killing by macrophages and NK cells. Our results demonstrate the utility of a novel mouse model for evaluating anti-human CD37 therapeutics and highlight the potential of IMGN529 for treatment of CLL and other CD37-positive B-cell malignancies.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</kwd><kwd>antibody-drug conjugate</kwd><kwd>CD37</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">Following approval of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, use of monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy has become increasingly common. Rituximab is now a staple of treatment regimens for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), demonstrating substantial clinical efficacy when combined with traditional chemotherapeutics.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> While anti-CD20 antibodies represent a major advance, relapse is virtually inevitable.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Neoplastic B-cells are not reliant upon CD20 for survival and rituximab resistance is common.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Compounds that target novel surface molecules with defined oncogenic signaling characteristics could enhance our therapeutic armament, synergize with existing treatments, and potentially circumvent resistance. One of the most promising alternative targets is CD37, a tetraspanin protein highly expressed on malignant B-cells in CLL and NHL.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> While a natural ligand for CD37 remains unknown, signaling induced by the anti-CD37 peptide SMIP-016 has implicated this tetraspanin as a mediator of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway. Through cytoplasmic ITAM and ITIM-like motifs with opposing functions, CD37 can directly participate in both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signaling by facilitating alterations in the phosphorylation state of Akt.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, CD37-deficient mice exhibit impaired generation of plasma cells as a result of defective Akt signaling in germinal center B-cells. <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p id="P6">Interest in targeting CD37 has led to the generation of several novel platforms of anti-CD37 therapeutics, including a small modular immunopharmaceutical peptide and an Fc-engineered IgG1 antibody that are currently in clinical trials for CLL.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> This was recently expanded to include IMGN529, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) in which the cytotoxic maytansine-derivative DM1 is linked to a CD37-targeting humanized IgG1 antibody via a stable SMCC linker.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This strategy seeks to combine the potent cytotoxicity demonstrated by anti-CD37 therapeutics with the specific delivery of DM1, which exerts anti-proliferative effects by disrupting microtubule dynamics during mitosis.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The clinical viability of DM1-conjugated antibodies has been demonstrated by ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, Kadcyla<sup>TM</sup>), now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Brentuximab vedotin, which is indicated for the treatment of refractory Hodgkins lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, is currently the only other ADC approved for marketing by the FDA.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, given that over 20 ADCs are currently under evaluation in human trials for a wide variety of indications, this therapeutic strategy seems poised to become increasingly prominent.</p><p id="P7">While CLL was once viewed as a malignancy driven by apoptosis resistance, the importance of a proliferative component and interactions between tumor and the tissue microenvironment has become increasingly apparent.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Current evidence suggests that a subset of transformed B-cells form proliferative centers in lymphoid tissues and are the source of the malignant cells which slowly accumulate in the peripheral blood.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>-<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup><italic>In vivo</italic> measurements indicate that birth rate of CLL B-cells can exceed 1% of the total malignant clone per day.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> However, it is still unknown whether ADCs carrying anti-mitotic payloads will have utility in CLL given that proliferation is lower than most subtypes of NHL.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p id="P8">The<italic> in vivo</italic> preclinical evaluation of antibodies targeting human CD37 (hCD37) has been impeded by the lack of cross-reactivity with mouse CD37. There are no animal models available for evaluating anti-CD37 therapeutics in the context of spontaneous B-cell malignancy, where complex microenvironment interactions in various disease compartments could influence therapeutic efficacy. To address this, we have generated a transgenic mouse which develops hCD37+ B-cell leukemia that is transplantable into syngenic hosts.

IMGN529 and its antibody component K7153A also mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against CLL by healthy donor NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We observed no significant difference between IMGN529 and K7153A with respect to their ability to mediate ADCC. Furthermore, both agents equally promoted phagocytosis of CLL by monocyte-derived macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S4</xref>).

Therefore, we performed B-cell depletion assays in CLL patient whole blood, where various innate immune components that may contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies (complement, NK cells, monocytes, and granulocytes) are present in physiologically relevant proportions to leukemia cells. One hour treatment of CLL patient whole blood with IMGN529 or K7153A resulted in significantly greater malignant B-cell depletion than rituximab or alemtuzumab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S5</xref>). In addition, CD37-targeted therapeutics avoided the undesirable T-cell depletion that is observed with anti-CD52 alemtuzumab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). A limited analysis suggests that activity in whole blood does not vary on the basis of cytogenetic abnormalities, although a much larger sample size would be required to achieve greater certainty (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S6</xref>).

In contrast to what was observed with non-dividing CLL B-cells, IMGN529 demonstrated superior cytotoxicity against Raji cells compared to its K7153A antibody component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Additional testing with the Mec-1 cell line yielded similar results (data not shown).

To evaluate CD37-directed IMGN529 in this capacity, we required a model accurately recapitulating the characteristics of human CLL while expressing the human CD37 (hCD37) target protein. As an initial step to address this need, we generated a hCD37 transgenic mouse (hCD37-Tg), which would eventually be crossed with an existing mouse model of CLL. The hCD37-Tg was created using an expression vector that contained IgV<sub>H</sub> promoter and Ig<sub>H</sub>-&#x003bc; enhancer elements to achieve B-cell specific hCD37 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>).

This hCD37&#x000d7;TCL1 model addresses the need for improved platforms to preclinically evaluate anti-human CD37 therapeutics. Specifically, it provides the first model of a low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder that expresses human CD37. We then utilize this model to demonstrate the potent <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of IMGN529, which to our knowledge is the first ADC shown to effectively target the proliferative component of CLL <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P29">Existing models for evaluating anti-CD37 therapeutics are limited by their inability to reproduce the full spectrum of disease associated with B-cell malignancies. The most commonly used approach involves xenografts of human cells into immunodeficient mice, but these models fail to demonstrate the same tumor behavior or typical interactions with the tissue microenvironment.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In CLL xenografts the injected cells largely remain in the peritoneal cavity, demonstrating a small presence of leukemic cells in the spleen and bone marrow while virtually no cells circulate in the peripheral blood.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Models of spontaneous leukemia such as the E&#x003bc;-TCL1 mouse produce a phenotype that more accurately portrays the compartmental distribution seen in human disease.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> The leukemia developed by the E&#x003bc;-TCL1 model closely resembles the more aggressive subtype of IgVH unmutated CLL, exhibiting similar behavior, immunodeficiencies, and epigenetic changes as those observed in the human disease.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The major disadvantage of this model, however, is that it cannot be utilized for preclinical evaluation of most therapeutic antibodies as they lack cross-reactivity with the mouse proteins. Expressing the human target protein in transgenic mice is an alternative, as when Heider et al did so to evaluate their Fc-engineered CD37 antibody <italic>in vivo.</italic><sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, this does not permit evaluation in the context of malignancy, where therapeutic efficacy may be dramatically altered. The hurdle for evaluating anti-CD37 therapies is overcome with the generation of our hCD37&#x000d7;TCL1 mouse model. In addition, the hCD37-Tg we used to generate this CLL model could be crossed with other models of spontaneous leukemia/lymphoma for testing CD37 targeted therapeutics in the context of different hematological malignancies.</p><p id="P30">Our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of IMGN529 show that conjugation of the CD37-targeting K7153A antibody to DM1 does not diminish its ability to promote effector-mediated killing of CLL by NK cells and macrophages. Furthermore, both IMGN529 and K7153A greatly surpass rituximab in their ability to deplete malignant B-cells in CLL patient whole blood. We also observed direct cytotoxicity against CLL in the absence of crosslinker, similar to what has been reported with another recently developed anti-CD37 therapeutic (mAb 37.1) but unlike the CD37-directed peptide TRU-016.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Interestingly, healthy donor B-cells were less sensitive to anti-CD37 induced apoptosis than human CLL B-cells or splenic B-cells from hCD37-Tg mice. This cannot be explained by decreased expression of the target protein, as normal B-cells do not have less surface CD37.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Both murine splenic B-cells and human CLL B-cells display high degrees of spontaneous apoptosis during <italic>in vitro</italic> culture. Therefore, observed differences in direct cytotoxicity could be a result of normal human B-cells exhibiting decreased priming to undergo apoptosis, thus reducing their sensitivity to anti-CD37 therapeutics (which are expected to induce expression of pro-apoptotic mitochondrial protein BIM following CD37 ligation).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p id="P31">IMGN529 and K7153A were able to mediate cytotoxicity against human CLL cells to the same level in our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. This is in sharp contrast to what was observed during our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, where K7153A produced only modest depletion of leukemic B-cells and was unable to significantly alter the disease course in our hCD37&#x000d7;TCL1 model. While its antibody alone was not effective, the full IMGN529 ADC rapidly eliminated peripheral blood leukemia, reversed splenomegaly and improved overall survival. The different <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> activity we observed with these agents is not entirely surprising given that CLL cells do not proliferate in culture, which would make the delivery of anti-mitotic DM1 largely irrelevant in these short-term <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. When tested against proliferating Raji cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, IMGN529 possessed a distinct advantage over its antibody component with enhanced cytotoxic activity resulting in G2/M cell cycle arrest. We hypothesized that IMGN529 eliminated dividing leukemia cells within the proliferative centers via targeted delivery of DM1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, thus resulting in a greater therapeutic benefit than the antibody alone. This is supported by the observation that peripheral leukemia depletion with IMGN529 was accompanied by a rapid decrease in splenomegaly. To further investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of IMGN529, we monitored its effects on leukemia cells within various compartments of disease and examined those from lymphoid tissues for signs of proliferation using EdU. In doing so, we demonstrated that IMGN529 is effective at targeting leukemia in both peripheral blood and the lymphoid compartment. EdU incorporation was largely absent among the few CD5+CD19+ cells that remained after 2 doses, suggesting that IMGN529 was indeed eliminating this proliferative subset of cells. Additionally, the splenomegaly observed with IgG-DM1 controls was not present in mice receiving IMGN529. While a small number of leukemia cells remained after 2 doses, it is evident that IMGN529 is highly active across multiple compartments of disease in this CLL mouse model. Given that the expression of hCD37 was suboptimal compared to human CLL, it is unlikely that antigen density has lead to an exaggerated response in the mouse model. For this reason, delivery of the cytotoxic DM1 payload is likely even more efficient on human CLL cells.</p><p id="P32">As clinical study of IMGN529 moves forward, it would be worthwhile to explore potential combination therapies that may take advantage of the unique therapeutic properties of this ADC. Given that IMGN529 maintains the Fc-mediated effector functions of the antibody from which it was generated, combination with immunomodulatory drugs (such as lenalidomide) could prove effective. The anti-CD37 peptide TRU-016 previously demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> synergy with PI3K inhibitors.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Therefore, it may also be worthwhile to explore combinations with inhibitors of PI3K&#x003b4; such as GS-1101 and IPI-145, which are both currently under evaluation in Phase III clinical trials for CLL. The newly generated hCD37&#x000d7;TCL1 mouse model provides a unique tool that will enable the evaluation of combination strategies for IMGN529 and other CD37-targeted therapeutics in an immunocompetent model of spontaneous CLL.</p><p id="P33">To summarize, we have generated a mouse model which develops a transplantable CD5+CD19+hCD37+ leukemia and demonstrated its utility for the evaluation of anti-CD37 therapeutics. This model facilitated improved preclinical studies of IMGN529, elucidating its robust anti-leukemic effects <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Healthy hCD37-Tg recipients were injected i.v. with 1&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> splenocytes from a leukemic hCD37&#x000d7;TCL1 donor. Mice were randomly assigned (n=6-7/group) for treatment with 10 mg/kg IMGN529 ADC, its K7153A antibody component, IgG-DM1 ADC control, or trastuzumab control. Treatment began following leukemia development, which was defined as when &#x0003e;20% of CD45+ events were CD5+CD19+ B-cells. Animals received a 10 mg/kg i.p. treatment on the day of leukemia diagnosis and repeat doses twice weekly for three weeks (70 mg/kg total). (B) Kaplan-Meier plot comparing the overall survival of engrafted mice. IMGN529 significantly improved survival relative to its IgG-DM1 control (p=0.042), while parent antibody K7153A had no survival benefit compared with trastuzumab control (p=0.94). Log-rank tests were used for statistical analysis. Arrow indicates day 20, when mice received their last injection. (C) Representative examples of flow cytometry performed on mice 24h after receiving their third dose. Whole blood was stained for CD45/CD19/CD5 and plots are gated on singlet CD45+ events. (D) Absolute concentration of the CD5+CD19+ B-cell population to which the leukemia belongs. Data expressed as mean +/&#x02212; SEM. Arrow indicates day 20, when mice received their last injection.
