The ear swelling response was measured and skin biopsies from oxazolone-sensitized skin areas were obtained for RNA isolation, immunohistochemical analyses and histology.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify mRNA expression of cytokines, chemokines and transcription factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The expression of proinflammatory [interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, IL-6], Th2 (IL-4) and Th17 type cytokines (IL-17), as well as regulatory components (TGF-&#x003b2;, Foxp3) increased significantly at the mRNA level in the skin of oxazolone-treated Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice when compared with wild-type controls. The expression of the Th1 type cytokine IFN-&#x003b3; and the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 was, however, unaffected by the lack of Smad3. The number of neutrophils and expression of the chemokines CCL3 and CXCL5, which are both involved in neutrophil recruitment, were increased in mice lacking Smad3. Also Th2 type chemokines CCL24, CCL3 and CXCL5 were increased in the skin of Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice compared with wild-type mice. In the lymph nodes, mRNA of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-17, but not IL-4, TGF-&#x003b2; or Foxp3, was increased in Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice during the CHS response.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The lack of intact TGF-&#x003b2; signalling via Smad3 results in an increased proinflammatory, Th2 and Th17 type response in the skin, as well as increased expression of regulatory elements such as TGF-&#x003b2; and Foxp3.

An increased expression of inflammatory cytokines was also detectable in the draining lymph nodes of the Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, although at less striking levels than in the skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p><p>The general concept is that CHS is mediated by IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD8+ T cells, while IL-2-, IL-4- and IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells regulate the response. There are, however, results that also indicate an effector role for CD4+ T cells in the CHS response to oxazolone in C57BL6 mice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> In addition, the Th2 type cytokine IL-4 might also have a proinflammatory role, as shown by impaired CHS responses in mice lacking IL-4.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> In this study, the level of IL-4 mRNA in the skin of Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice was strongly increased after exposure to oxazolone, while the expression of IFN-&#x003b3; remained at the same level in Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice as in their WT siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3d, f</xref>). Thus, IFN-&#x003b3; production by, presumably, mainly CD8+ T cells in this model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> is not affected by the lack of Smad3. In contrast, the production of IL-4, mainly by CD4+ T cells, according to previous findings,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> is strongly modulated by the lack of Smad3.</p><p>Several studies have shown that TGF-&#x003b2; can inhibit both Th1 and Th2 differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>, and that Th2 differentiation is more sensitive to inhibition by TGF-&#x003b2;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> Studies with Smad3-deficient immune cells have shown that Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; T cells have an activated phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; spleen cells have defective TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated inhibition of cytokine production <italic>in vitro</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> Thus, the significantly increased production of IL-4 mRNA in Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; skin after oxazolone exposure might be a consequence of reduced inhibition of IL-4 production by TGF-&#x003b2;, or increased conversion of CD4+ T cells into IL-4-producing Th2 cells. Moreover, there was a slight tendency towards increased numbers of CD3+ and CD4+ cells in the skin of Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, which also could contribute to the increased expression of IL-4. Nevertheless, the expression of high levels of IL-4 mRNA after oxazolone exposure was restricted to the skin and was not detected in the lymph nodes in Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice.</p><p>IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and TGF-&#x003b2; are essential for the differentiation of Th17 cells in mice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> After exposure to oxazolone, all three of them were significantly increased at the mRNA level in the skin in Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, and they were also abundant in lymph nodes. We consequently found increased levels of IL-17, product of Th17 cells, both in the skin and in the lymph nodes of Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice during the CHS response to oxazolone.

These results suggest there are other than Smad3-dependent pathways of Foxp3 induction at the site of inflammation. Our results also indicate that IL-10 is not involved in that pathway. Notably, in the lymph nodes of Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; control mice, there was a high level of TGF-&#x003b2; expression, and a tendency for increased expression of IL-10 and Foxp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5b&#x02013;d</xref>) compared with WT, suggesting increased regulatory activity in general in mice that lack Smad3.</p><p>The CCR3 receptor is expressed predominately by eosinophils, and to a smaller extent by basophils and Th2 polarized lymphocytes,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> which are all relevant to allergic inflammation. CCR3 ligands, such as the Th2-associated CCL24/eotaxin-2, amplify the Th2 response in allergic inflammation. In this study, the mRNA of both CCR3 and CCL24 was significantly elevated in the skin of oxazolone-challenged Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, which may reflect the slight (although not statistically significant) increase of eosinophil infiltration in the skin of Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice.</p><p>During acute inflammation, an initial infiltration of neutrophils characterizes the leucocyte recruitment, being later replaced by monocytes, lymphocytes and other inflammatory cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> According to earlier studies, Smad3 deficiency impairs the chemotactic response of neutrophils to TGF-&#x003b2;<italic>in vitro</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> Accordingly, in wound healing experiments, both neutrophils and monocytes were largely absent in mice lacking Smad3.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> In contrast to these findings, we observed that during the CHS response to oxazolone there is a significantly increased neutrophil infiltration into the skin of mice that lack Smad3. We also analysed the expression levels of chemokines CCL3/MIP-1&#x003b1; and CXCL5/LIX, which are both involved in neutrophil recruitment,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> and both of these chemokines were significantly increased at the mRNA level in oxazolone-exposed skin of Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. It has been demonstrated that TGF-&#x003b2; inhibits CCL3 expression, mediated via Smad3 in macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> which might explain our observations of increased CCL3 as well as CXCL5 during the CHS response in Smad3&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. The increased levels of attracting chemokines (CCL3 and CXCL5), in turn, might bring about the increased infiltration of neutrophils into the skin. Evidence is also accumulating that IL-17, which was significantly increased in Smad3-deficient lymph nodes and skin during the oxazolone response, significantly stimulates neutrophil maturation, migration and function.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref></p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that Smad3-mediated signalling pathways play an important part in the CHS response to oxazolone. Complete loss of this signalling intermediate resulted in accelerated expression of proinflammatory, Th17 and Th2 type cytokines in the skin, as well as increased infiltration of neutrophils to the site of inflammation. Moreover, the lack of Smad3 in knockout mice did not result in reduced, but rather increased expression of Foxp3 mRNA and elevated numbers of Foxp3+ cells in the skin during the CHS response. Unravelling the mechanisms in TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated regulation of CHS may provide insights for future prevention and treatment modalities in this often disabling disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank The Finnish Society of Allergology and Immunology, the Research Funds of Helsinki Uusimaa Hospital District (EVO), the Nummela Sanatoriums Stiftelse, the Allergy and Asthma Association, The Medical Association of Finland and the Academy of Finland for financial support.
