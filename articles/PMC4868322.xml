As TLR9 requires endolysosomal proteolytic cleavage to achieve signaling functionality, we investigated the contribution of different proteases like asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) or cysteine protease cathepsins B (CatB), L (CatL) and S (CatS) to host resistance during <italic>Leishmania major</italic> (<italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>) infection in C57BL/6 (WT) mice and whether they would impact on TLR9 signaling. Unlike TLR9<sup>-/-</sup>, which are more susceptible to infection, AEP<sup>-/-</sup>, CatL<sup>-/-</sup> and CatS<sup>-/-</sup> mice are as resistant to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection as WT mice, suggesting that these proteases are not individually involved in TLR9 processing. Interestingly, we observed that CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice resolve <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> lesions significantly faster than WT mice, however we did not find evidence for an involvement of CatB on either TLR9-dependent or independent cytokine responses of dendritic cells and macrophages or in the innate immune response to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection. We also found no difference in antigen presenting capacity. We observed a more precocious development of T helper 1 responses accompanied by a faster decline of inflammation, resulting in resolution of footpad inflammation, reduced IFN&#x003b3; levels and decreased parasite burden. Adoptive transfer experiments into alymphoid RAG2<sup>-/-</sup>&#x003b3;c<sup>-/-</sup> mice allowed us to identify CD3+ T cells as responsible for the immune advantage of CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice towards <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>. <italic>In vitro</italic> data confirmed the T cell intrinsic differences between CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice and WT.

Toll like receptors play an important role in the recognition and initiation of immune responses, and the intracellular TLR9, a sensor of pathogen double-stranded DNA, plays a crucial role in host resistance to <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites. To achieve functionality, proteolytic enzymes, like cathepsins B, L, or S or asparagine endopeptidase, must cleave TLR9. Using mice deficient for different cathepsins, we demonstrate that these cathepsins do not seem to be individually involved in TLR9 processing. Interestingly we observed that Cathepsin B-deficient mice were more resistant to <italic>Leishmania major</italic> infection, meaning they resolve lesions and reduce parasite burdens faster than wild-type C57BL/6 mice. We found that this resistance is based on adaptive rather than innate immunity, with a central role of Cathepsin B-deficient T cells that contribute to faster controls of <italic>leishmania</italic> probably by higher IFN&#x003b3; production. Cathepsin B inhibitors were already shown to have favorable effect in leishmaniasis, but the mechanisms behind these effects remain unclear. Our study highlights a new role for cathepsin B at the T cell level and provides new clues to how targeting this molecule is beneficial for treating <italic>leishmania</italic> infections.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10-MIDI-0008</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Pasteur Paris Univeristy (PPU)</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7040-9587</contrib-id><name><surname>Rasid</surname><given-names>Orhan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>EFIS-IL Fellowship</institution></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Institut Pasteur and an ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) grant (10-MIDI-0008) to ND with a post-doctoral fellowship for CB.

This supports macrophages in the induction of anti-leishmanial effector functions, such as production of nitric oxide [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. IL-12, a cytokine produced largely by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs), contributes to immunity against <italic>Leishmania major</italic> (<italic>L</italic>. <italic>major)</italic> by both polarizing and supporting T helper (Th) 1 responses [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The capacity of DCs to produce IL-12 is directly conditioned by the recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). This is achieved through a variety of receptors, of which Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are by far the best characterized [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A large body of knowledge has been accumulated on the recognition of <italic>Leishmania</italic> by different TLRs [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We, and others, have previously described a critical role for intracellular TLR9, a sensor of pathogen double-stranded DNA, in recognition and host resistance to <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. TLR9 requires a proteolytic cleavage step inside the endolysosome to achieve signaling functionality. TLR9 maturation was proposed to be a multistep process requiring, among other molecules, the contribution of asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) and other cysteine proteases such as cathepsins B (CatB), L (CatL) or S (CatS) [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although analysis of TLR9 processing and signaling supported a role for both cathepsins and AEP in macrophages and DCs, there is no consensus on their contribution to TLR9 maturation and its consequences on innate immunity. In <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection, despite the known importance of DCs in polarizing Th responses and the role of cysteine proteases in modulating DC functions, the role of these proteins remains poorly understood. The importance of the Th1/Th2 balance for protective immunity in leishmaniasis is clearly illustrated by the susceptibility of the prototypical Th2 BALB/c mouse strain as opposed to the resistance of Th1-prone C57BL/6 or DBA/2 mice [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Cathepsins have been the subject of a few studies during <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection and use of specific inhibitors has been shown to skew Th responses [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Inhibiting CatB was suggested to favor the development of protective Th1 responses in BALB/c but not in DBA/2, whereas inhibition of CatL exacerbated the disease in both BALB/c and DBA/2 mice [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Still, further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms behind these effects. The role of AEP and CatS however, has not been investigated in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection. We thus set out to investigate how AEP, CatB, CatL and CatS affect the immune response during <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection with the aim of assessing if TLR9-dependent responses are affected by these proteases. Comparing mice deficient in AEP, CatB, CatL and CatS, we observed that only CatB-deficient mice were more resistant to infection, meaning they resolve lesions and reduce parasite burdens faster than C57BL/6 (WT) mice. We went on to test the involvement of CatB in TLR9-dependent DC responses and found no impact of CatB. We performed a thorough analysis of the local immune responses to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> and found no major differences in the innate immune response to infection between WT and CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We however found a clear difference in the Th1 response between the two mouse strains, observing a somewhat faster apparition and a consistently speedier decline of IFN&#x003b3; levels in CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Having observed no differences in innate responses or antigen presenting capacity of DCs we investigated whether CatB might affect lymphocyte populations, as previous studies have suggested [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Using a series of adoptive transfer and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments we found that CD3+ T are intrinsically different in CatB mice and can confer an immune advantage to recipient alymphoid mice upon transfer, as compared to their WT counterparts. To our knowledge this is the first study to identify a T cell-intrinsic role for CatB in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection and thus setting the stage for a new direction of research into the role of cysteine proteases in <italic>Leishmania</italic> protozoan infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Animals were housed in the Institut Pasteur animal facilities accredited by the French Ministry of Agriculture to perform experiments on mice in compliance of the French and European regulations on care and protection of the Laboratory Animals (EC Directive 86/609, French Law 2001&#x02013;486 issued on June 6, 2001).

To complete our investigation of adaptive responses during <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection, we explored the dynamics of T cell related cytokines in dLNs and FPs of infected mice. We compared the expression profile of Th1 (IFN&#x003b3;) and Th2-associated (IL-4 and IL-10) mRNAs in dLNs of WT and CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice during infection since we found no detectable transcripts in the FPs. While we observe increased IFN&#x003b3; expression at early moments in CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice, this trend is quickly lost past day 21 p.i. reaching significantly lower levels compared to WT from day 28 p.i. onward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004716.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Interestingly, this tendency of CatB<sup>-/-</sup> to express higher levels of IFN&#x003b3; like at day 14 p.i. was corroborated by a significantly lower expression of IL-4 transcripts in these mice at day 7 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004716.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). IL-4 expression further decreased and showed no significant differences during the rest of the observation period. We also observed a lower IL-10 transcript expression in CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice around day 21&#x02013;28 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004716.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) Since the IFN&#x003b3;-inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) axis is well recognized as an effector mechanism in leishmaniasis we also monitored the levels of iNOS transcripts in dLNs and FPs of infected mice. CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice had significantly lower levels of iNOS in the dLNs compared to WT from day 21 to 28 p.i. and a similar tendency further on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004716.g006">Fig 6D</xref>).

The work presented here aimed at investigating the functional consequences that different proteases, reported to intervene in the functional maturation of TLR9, might have on the evolution of cutaneous <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection. Using mice genetically deficient for AEP, CatB, CatL and CatS we found that only CatB<sup>-/-</sup> were significantly different from WT mice. These mice showed a faster dynamic and increased efficiency of cutaneous lesion resolution and clearance of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> parasites. Previous studies on the role of cathepsins during <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection revealed different effects of cathepsin inhibition. Targeting cathepsin B by specific inhibitors was reported to be protective in BALB/c mice but with no effect on DBA/2 mice [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In agreement with these studies we report a protective phenotype in CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice. CatL inhibitors on the other hand, were reported to exacerbate disease in susceptible BALB/c and resistant DBA/2 mice [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We find no effect of CatL, although factors like specificity of the inhibitors as opposed to genetic deletion might be responsible for the different results. Our results complete and expand on existing literature by the use of AEP and CatS knockout mice, where we find no major difference in disease progression and parasite clearance. To our knowledge this is the first report on the role of these proteases during <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection. The slightly higher susceptibility, which we observed in the CatS<sup>-/-</sup> mice, might be linked to an incomplete maturation of TLR9 or a breakdown in cleavage of the MHCII invariant chain, as previously reported for this cathepsin [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

However, we can also not exclude a compensatory role for any given cathepsin in the absence of the other.</p><p>Looking for a role of cathepsin B in the response to TLR9 stimulation, we assessed APC cytokine responses of WT and CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice to CpG and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>. We found no influence of CatB on responsiveness of BMDCs or BMDMs to TLR9-dependent or independent stimulation in terms of cytokine transcription or production. In opposition to our finding, a recent study reported that CatB deficiency affects both antigen presentation and IL-12 production from APCs upon stimulation with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. While we did not assess protein levels of IL-12, we did not observe significant differences between WT and CatB<sup>-/-</sup> DCs in terms of the transcriptionally regulated expression of IL-12p35 [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] to live or killed <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> or other stimulants like LPS and CpG. However minor variations in experimental conditions like composition of culture media, type of serum and growth factors used might also be responsible of the observed differences. We also find similarities with the aforementioned work, like no difference in IL-6 production in response to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>. Differential harvest times might also explain why we see no differences in TNF response to LPS, as reported by Ha <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], however as the authors themselves mention, TNF can probably be secreted through a cathepsin B independent pathway. Interestingly, membrane-associated TNF was shown to be sufficient to protect mice during leishmania infection [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. But a subsequent study showed that this was also dependent on the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> strain used [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].

Indeed, degradation was very partial and the size of the fragments still very far from those of the peptides which are presented. To address this question, we assessed the antigen presenting capacity of BMDCs from WT and CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We found no difference between the antigen presenting capacity of cells from both mice strains; BMDCs being as efficient at triggering IFN&#x003b3; secretion from <italic>in vivo</italic> primed T cells. As originally described, we found that cathepsin B is dispensable for MHC class II presentation [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Once again we saw no indication of a role of APCs (DCs) in the difference in anti-leishmanial T cell responses, although we cannot exclude a difference in antigen presentation by other cells like B cells [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>The resistant C57BL/6 genetic background of WT and CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection allowed us to compare immune parameters over a long course of infection in a high-dose and relevant model of self-resolving leishmaniasis. We defined the soluble mediators and cellular components of the inflammatory response. Overall, WT mice responded to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> with a delayed, enhanced and more sustained inflammation as compared to CatB<sup>-/-</sup>. This inflammatory pattern was characterized by higher local chemokine levels accompanied by a significantly increased infiltration with neutrophils in both FPs and dLNs that persists beyond day 21 of infection in WT mice. High neutrophil numbers at the site of inoculation reflect the inflammatory state but have also been shown to correlate with immune escape in leishmaniasis [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], neutrophils being considered as a Trojan horse used by the parasite to evade the immune system [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The higher levels of IL-6 and TNF we find in dLNs of CatB<sup>-/-</sup> at day 7 p.i. are interesting, yet difficult to correlate with a response that might favour Th1 priming. Although the role of IL-6 during <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection has been previously investigated, it was shown to have no major effect or at least not on early responses [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] TNF however, was shown to have a clear protective role in L. major infection, with higher TNF levels in C57BL/6 mice compared to BALB/c [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We did not observe impairment in IL-1&#x003b2; secretion in CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice, these results being consistent with a cathepsin B-independent activation of IL-1&#x003b2;, especially since multiple cathepsins have been implicated in NLRP3-mediated IL-1&#x003b2; activation [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Our results thus point to a minor influence of CatB deficiency on the innate response during <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection.</p><p>A delicate balance between Th1 and Th2 is supported as the turning point for anti-leishmanial immunity and this conclusion has benefited greatly by studies in prototypical Th1 and Th2 mice, C57BL/6 and BALB/c, respectively [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. An early Th2 has been reported to develop in C57BL/6 mice, which is afterwards shut down and dominated by a protective Th1 [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Accompanying the favorable phenotype of CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we observed that an adaptive Th1 response started at earlier time-points and was resolved faster as compared to WT mice. Previous reports on use of cathepsin B inhibitors have shown that <italic>in vivo</italic> treatment of infected BALB/c mice can suppress the development of a deleterious Th2 [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Consistent with these early studies, we observed a tendency of CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice to express higher levels of IFN&#x003b3; and lower levels of IL-4 in the early phases of disease. This trend was lost after day 21 when CatB<sup>-/-</sup> Th1 markers fall below those of WT mice. We were not able to detect transcript for these cytokines in the FPs, probably because of the low numbers of T cell present at this site as compared to the dLNs. We did however find very high iNOS transcript upregulation in the FPs. While WT mice maintain higher levels of Th1 cytokines and increased cellularity in the dLNs, they also maintain a relatively high size of FP lesions and parasite burdens. These observations have already been described and attributed to anti-inflammatory mechanisms like Treg expansion and IL-10 secretion which allow persistence of the parasite [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We observed a difference in the representation of T cell populations in CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice, characterized by a higher percentage of CD4, among which a lower percentage of cells were CD25+foxp3+ Tregs. This difference was present in na&#x000ef;ve mice and maintained during the course of infection indicating that the equilibrium between effector and regulatory T cells as described by Belkaid <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] is higher in C57BL/6 mice than in CatB<sup>-/-</sup>, which might explain the faster development and regression of the inflammatory response in these mice. To further evaluate the immune status of infected mice, we examined the proportion of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major-</italic>specific IgG subclasses. Except for a higher abundance of antibodies in CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we found no indication of a preferential skewing of the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio. Since we did not observe higher, but in fact lower percentages of B cells in CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice during later stages of the disease, we believe that a qualitative difference in Th-responses at early moments might induce the differences we observe in IgG levels.</p><p>Cathepsin B is one of the most abundant cysteine proteases not only present in lysosomes of APCs but also in B and T lymphocytes [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and has been described to be implicated in different inflammatory disease [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Lysosomal proteases were believed to be mainly involved in different types of cell death. Aside from the role of cathepsin B in promoting cell death, a different line of research suggested that surface cathepsine B protects cytotoxic lymphocytes and NK cells from self-destruction after degranulation [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These results were obtained with highly specific cathepsin B inhibitors, but were not confirmed by Baran <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], using CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In addition it has been shown that <italic>in vitro</italic> supra optimal activation induces apoptosis of T cells due to release of catalytically active CatB and CatL in the cytosol [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>Considering the possible effects of cathepsin B on lymphocytes, we turned to a system in which we could prove the involvement of lymphocytic cells in the CatB phenotype. We initially reconstituted RAG2<sup>-/-</sup>&#x003b3;c<sup>-/-</sup> mice with splenocytes from either WT or CatB<sup>-/-</sup> and observed FP thickness after infection with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>. RAG2<sup>-/-</sup>&#x003b3;c<sup>-/-</sup> mice reconstituted with CatB<sup>-/-</sup> splenocytes developed significantly smaller lesions throughout the course of infection compared with mice reconstituted with WT cells. While this result argues for a mostly lymphocytic origin of the observed differences, we could not exclude the influence of small myeloid populations in the spleen. Further experiments led to similar observations with the use of isolated CD3+ T cells. These results argue that, at least in our RAG2<sup>-/-</sup>&#x003b3;c<sup>-/-</sup> reconstitution system, B cells and NK cells along with other non-T cell populations in the spleen, do not contribute much to the development of local inflammation during <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> infection. We found significantly lower parasite burdens in the FP of RAG2<sup>-/-</sup>&#x003b3;c<sup>-/-</sup> mice reconstituted with CatB<sup>-/-</sup> T cells as compared to WT T cells. As previously described [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], RAG2<sup>-/-</sup>&#x003b3;c<sup>-/-</sup> mice fail to contain systemic dissemination of leishmanial parasites due to lack of lymph nodes, which might also account for the lack of resolution we observed in these mice. Differences in cellular phenotype similar to those found between dLNs of WT and CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice were also found in the spleens of reconstituted mice, as a higher percentage of CD4 + cells with significantly fewer CD4+CD25+ cells among them. In RAG2<sup>-/-</sup>&#x003b3;c<sup>-/-</sup> mice reconstituted with CatB<sup>-/-</sup> T cells we observed a lower percentage of CD8 + as compared to WT in spleen, which was in accordance to the original phenotype of the transferred cells. The lower level of CD8 could explain the better resolution of the inflammatory response as previously suggested by Belkaid <italic>et al</italic>, which showed that CD8 T cells contribute to inflammation in a RAG2<sup>-/-</sup> reconstitution model [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>These points led us to study the cytokine production capacity and the ability to proliferate of T cells. We found that CatB<sup>-/-</sup> T cells have an intrinsic capacity to secrete more IFN&#x003b3; but are less able to produce IL-2 and proliferate <italic>in vitro</italic>. Altogether, the data underline that intrinsic differences in the T cell compartment exist between WT and CatB<sup>-/-</sup> mice which evoke a precocious Th1 response, probably as a result of a higher IFN&#x003b3; production capacity, and faster resolution of inflammation which could be attributed to the lower proliferative capacity of CatB<sup>-/-</sup> CD3 T cells. We cannot at this moment say if the differences in T cell reactivity imply a cell-intrinsic role for CatB or are the result of development and selection of T cells in a CatB<sup>-/-</sup> -environment. Given the ubiquitous expression of CatB and the many functions attributed to this protease, identifying a precise mechanism of action might prove very difficult. In addition to the differences in cytokine secretion capacity and proliferation we report for T cells, cathepsin B might affect other processes that may influence <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> disease progression like the reported role in cleavage of chemokines or IL-1 processing [<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004716.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>Unanswered questions remain on the source of these functional differences within the T cell population. The imbalance in CD8, CD4 and Treg might be a first reason to consider, followed by the individual competence of each of these populations. The increased inflammatory capacity correlates with a possible defect in Treg suppressive capacity.</p><p>Cathepsin B has already been proposed as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases, and for leishmaniasis, and our work brings forth new evidence on the effects that cathepsin B inhibition might have at the T cell level, and sets the stage for future investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004716.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Parasite burdens of WT, CatL-, CatS- and AEP-knockout mice.</title><p>WT, CatS<sup>-/-</sup>, CatL<sup>-/-</sup> and AEP<sup>-/-</sup> mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 3x10<sup>6</sup> stationary phase promastigotes of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic> in the footpads and experimental read-outs were measured at indicated time-points.
