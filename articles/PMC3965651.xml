Here, we show that respiratory virus-specific memory T cells in mice and humans are generated and maintained in compartmentalized niches in lungs, distinct from populations in lymphoid tissue or circulation. Using a polyclonal mouse model of influenza infection combined with an <italic>in vivo</italic> antibody labeling approach and confocal imaging, we identify a spatially distinct niche in the lung where influenza-specific T cell responses are expanded and maintained long term as tissue resident memory (T<sub>RM</sub>) CD4 and CD8 T cells. Lung T<sub>RM</sub> are further distinguished from circulating memory subsets in lung and spleen based on CD69 expression and persistence independent of lymphoid stores. In humans, influenza-specific T cells are enriched within the lung T<sub>RM</sub> subset, while memory CD8 T cells specific for the systemic virus CMV are distributed in both lung and spleen, suggesting that the site of infection affects T<sub>RM</sub> generation. Our findings reveal a precise spatial organization to virus-specific T cell memory, determined by the site of the initial infection, with important implications for the development of targeted vaccination and strategies to boost immunity at appropriate tissue sites.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">Respiratory infection generates T cell responses detectable in lymphoid tissue and lung. The relative contribution of circulating and site-specific immunity to longterm memory responses and the mechanisms which govern their generation and maintenance remain poorly understood in both mouse models and humans. In the case of respiratory viruses such as influenza, infection is confined to the lung, yet systemic immune responses are generated--including flu-specific antibodies in serum and lung <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, and virus-specific memory T cells in multiple tissues including lungs, spleen, lymph nodes, and liver <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Because memory CD4 and CD8 T cells can be cross-reactive to multiple flu strains<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, and can provide heterotypic protection in mouse models, they are key targets for promoting successful respiratory immunity. Defining the role of anatomic localization in the development and maintenance of anti-viral T cell memory responses in influenza and other viruses can therefore alter the way in which we design, monitor and target vaccines.</p><p id="P3">Heterogeneous distribution of virus-specific T cells in lymphoid and non-lymphoid sites occurs following infection with respiratory or systemic viruses <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, suggesting that maintaining diversity in the memory T cell population may be advantageous for protection. However, the extent to which an initial immune response to influenza in the lung remains compartmentalized is not known, and has been difficult to establish whether a particular T cell in the lung recirculates or remains localized. Recent studies suggest that subsets of memory T cells are retained at specific sites as tissue-resident memory T cells or T<sub>RM</sub>, and may confer an effective <italic>in situ</italic> first line of defense to tissue-specific infections<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. CD8 T<sub>RM</sub> have been described in the skin<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, brain<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, gut<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, vaginal mucosae<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, and lung<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, while CD4 T<sub>RM</sub> have not been as well-defined. We recently identified a subset of TCR-transgenic, influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-specific lung memory CD4 T cells that were specifically retained in the lung and did not circulate to other sites <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. These lung resident memory CD4 T cells mediated optimal protection to influenza infection, while spleen-derived HA-specific memory CD4 T cells did not confer significant protection, despite their migration to the lung <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Together, these findings suggested that lung T<sub>RM</sub> may occupy a distinct compartment in the lung compared to spleen memory T cells which could circulate to multiple tissue sites. Whether T<sub>RM</sub> are generated distinct from circulating populations or derive from lymphoid progenitors is not known.</p><p id="P4">In this study, we investigated the generation, maintenance and localization of influenza-specific memory T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in situ</italic> in a polyclonal mouse model and in humans to address the hypothesis that the respiratory viruses generate specific memory T cell subsets that remain compartmentalized in the lung. Using an intravenous antibody labeling approach to differentiate between resident and circulatory T cells in the lung following influenza infection, we identified subsets of phenotypically distinct memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, which segregate within specific lung niches near the airways and in bronchovascular bundles. T cells within this niche were enriched for influenza-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells, expressed phenotypic markers associated with T<sub>RM</sub>, including CD69, CD11a, and CD103, and were maintained long term after viral clearance, independent of replenishment from lymphoid stores. Importantly, in humans, influenza-specific CD8 T cells were enriched within the lung T<sub>RM</sub> subset, while memory CD8 T cells specific for the systemic virus CMV persisted as circulating populations in lung and spleen. Together, our results establish that T cell memory to respiratory viruses is generated and maintained in a spatially compartmentalized niche in the lung, creating organized foci of influenza-specific immune cells at the sites of pathogen entry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Influenza infection alters the distribution and accessibility of CD4 T cells in the lung</title><p id="P5">Previous studies have analyzed tissue distribution and residence of virus-specific T cells using T cell receptor (TCR)-transgenic T cells<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Here, we assessed how tissue residence and location influenced the development of influenza-specific memory T cells in unmanipulated, polyclonal mice as a more physiologically relevant system. We used an <italic>in vivo</italic> antibody labeling approach to differentiate cells in circulation and in tissues, in which fluorescently-coupled anti-CD4 antibody (IV anti-CD4) is administered intravenously to mice 10 minutes prior to lung tissue perfusion and harvest. Using IV anti-CD4, T cells accessible to circulation bind fluorescent Ab, while those embedded in the tissues and inaccessible to circulation are protected from labeling. We administered IV anti-CD4 to na&#x000ef;ve and flu-infected BALB/c or C57BL/6 (B6) mice at different timepoints following infection to distinguish between T cells accessible to circulation that become labeled with antibody <italic>in vivo</italic> (&#x0201c;Labeled&#x0201d; subset) versus those within tissues which are protected from antibody labeling (&#x0201c;Protected&#x0201d; subset).</p><p id="P6">The kinetics of CD4 T cell recruitment and maintenance in the lung was assessed in na&#x000ef;ve and flu-infected mice following IV anti-CD4 administration. In peripheral blood of naive and infected mice, the vast majority (&#x0003e;98%) of CD4 T cells were labeled following IV anti-CD4 infusion (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1s</xref>), indicating the efficiency of <italic>in vivo</italic> antibody binding of circulating T cells. In the lungs of na&#x000ef;ve or mock-infected mice, &#x0003e;90% of CD4 T cells were labeled, with only a small fraction (&#x0003c; 10%) of total CD4 T cells protected from labeling (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a and b</xref>). Following intranasal infection with influenza virus, the proportion of protected lung CD4 T cells increased dramatically, comprising &#x0003e;25% of total lung CD4 T cells as early as 3 days post-infection, peaking at 60&#x02013;70% of lung CD4 T cells at day 10 p.i., and remaining elevated for up to 3 weeks p.i., with concomitant reductions in the proportion of labeled CD4 T cells at these timepoints (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a and b</xref>). The elevated proportion of protected CD4 T cells in the lung during acute influenza infection was likewise reflected in a 3&#x02013;5-fold increase in the absolute number of protected CD4 T cells between day 3 and 10 post-infection, and this number remained high up to three weeks post-infection (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). At later times post-infection, when virus is cleared and viral antigens are no longer presented (&#x02265;day 28), the frequency of protected cells was reduced to a range of 20&#x02013;40% (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a and b</xref>), which was stably maintained &#x0003e;120 days post-infection (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). The absolute number of protected memory CD4 T cells at these later timepoints from 1&#x02013;4 months post-infection was reduced compared to acute infection, but significantly increased compared to numbers in na&#x000ef;ve mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c, e</xref>). These long-term protected T cells in the lung were not found significantly in bronchiolar lavage fluid (BAL), (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 2s</xref>), further indicating that they are within the lung tissue.</p><p id="P7">Intravenous antibody labeling also revealed subsets of labeled and protected CD4 T cells in the spleen (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 1s</xref>), similar to findings with splenic CD8 T cells<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, and corresponding to T cells in the red pulp and inside follicles, respectively (<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and data not shown). The frequency of protected and labeled CD4 T cells in spleen was not appreciably altered during the course of influenza infection (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1s</xref>), indicating that the increase in protected T cells due to respiratory virus infection is specific to the lung. Therefore, quantitation of CD4 T cells during infection in a precise spatial location of the lung&#x02014;defined here as the protected region-- reveals the kinetics and magnitude of a primary T cell response to infection, with an initial period of expansion/recruitment peaking between day 10&#x02013;14 pi, followed by a contraction phase with a stable population of memory T cells maintained after viral clearance.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>In vivo labeling defines phenotypic and functional subsets of CD4 T cells in na&#x000ef;ve and flu-infected lungs</title><p id="P8">We then assessed whether labeled and protected T cells comprised distinct phenotypic and functional subsets.

During acute influenza infection (day 10 pi), the majority of total lung CD4 T cells exhibit an effector-like or effector-memory (T<sub>EM</sub>) phenotype (CD44hi/CD62Llo); while effector cells are found in both labeled and protected subsets, all protected T cells were effector cells, and the small fraction of na&#x000ef;ve T cells was exclusively in the labeled fraction (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, middle row, and 2b).

These results indicate that <italic>in vivo</italic> labeling can distinguish between two functionally distinct T cell subsets in the lung: na&#x000ef;ve T cells that are readily accessible to circulation, and effector and T<sub>EM</sub> CD4 T cells which are protected from IV anti-CD4 and in a circulation-inaccessible zone.</p><p id="P9">The early T cell activation marker CD69 was upregulated exclusively in the protected memory CD4 T cell subset in the lung, while labeled memory and na&#x000ef;ve subsets were predominantly CD69-negative in the lung (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>) and spleen (data not shown). During the course of influenza infection, the frequency of CD69-expressing protected memory CD4 T cells fluctuated early after infection (day 3 p.i., <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>), likely indicating the influx of effector cells which can downregulate this early activation marker.

We used confocal microscopy to determine the distribution of the labeled and protected memory CD4 T cells in thick sections of the lung after <italic>in vivo</italic> labeling of na&#x000ef;ve and flu-infected mice (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Labeled CD4 T cells were directly stained <italic>in vivo</italic> and appear blue or blue-violet, and protected CD4 T cells were revealed by <italic>ex vivo</italic> staining with a non-overlapping anti-CD4 antibody and appear red. For visualization of lung tissue structures, we used fluorescently-conjugated ECL lectin<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> which bind Type I alveolar epithelial cells and/or anti-collagen I antibodies which bind columnar epithelial cells around airways (see methods). In lungs of na&#x000ef;ve mice, labeled CD4 T cells (blue) localize within the walls of the alveoli (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3s-a</xref>), while protected lymphocytes (red) are only sparsely represented (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). During acute infection (day 5 p.i.), however, there was a large increase in the numbers and appearance of protected cells which localized in large clusters around airways (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>), while labeled T cells were not significantly observed (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>, left). Protected CD4 T cells in acutely infected lungs filled the expanded space between the airways and lung parenchyma (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>), and likely represent effector cells. After viral clearance (3&#x02013;4weeks p.i.), both protected and labeled cells can be fully visualized (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, left), but occupy distinct spatial locations within the tissue: Protected memory CD4 T cells were observed in clusters in the narrow space around airways and near pulmonary vessels that make up bronchovascular bundles, while labeled CD4 T cells were distributed throughout the lung parenchyma and near alveolar walls and did not form clusters (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c and d</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 3s-b</xref>). The persistence of protected CD4 T cells in the vicinity of airways is further shown in lung sections stained with anti-collagen antibodies without the alveolar staining (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>), and we did not observe them around minor blood vessels not associated with airways. These results therefore establish that protected T cells occupy a spatially distinct niche of the lung in a region near the site of antigen entry into the lung via airways.</p><p id="P11">We further examined whether the protected memory CD4 T cells persisting near the lung airways also upregulate CD69 <italic>in situ</italic>.

In all cases, flu-specific IFN-&#x003b3; secretion was detected predominantly by protected lung CD4 T<sub>RM</sub>, and exceeded by 10-fold the frequency of flu-specific IFN-&#x003b3; production by labeled lung memory CD4 T cells and by splenic CD4 T cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). Interestingly, in the spleen, there was no bias in the distribution of flu-specific cells among protected and labeled CD4 T cell subsets, further establishing that segregation of flu-specific memory CD4 T cells into a spatial niche occurred only at the site of infection in the lungs. Moreover, protected lung T<sub>RM</sub> CD4 T cells also responded to influenza challenge <italic>in vivo</italic>, while the labeled subset did not exhibit a significant recall response (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4s</xref>), indicating that lung T<sub>RM</sub> are the early responders <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P13">Using a similar IV Ab labeling approach, we investigated the distribution of CD8 T cells in different lung niches after influenza infection. In lungs of na&#x000ef;ve or mock-infected mice, the vast majority (&#x0003e;90%) of lung CD8 T cells were labeled by IV Ab (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>, left), similar to CD4 T cells in na&#x000ef;ve lungs. In flu-memory mice (&#x0003e;40 days post-infection) however, &#x0003e;70% of lung CD8 T cells were protected from IV anti-CD8.

By contrast, the overall percentage of flu tetramer-positive (Tet<sup>+</sup>) cells in the spleen was significantly lower than in the protected lung niche and there was no difference in their frequency in protected and labeled fractions of splenic CD8 T cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). In terms of absolute numbers, there were greater overall numbers of Tet<sup>+</sup> cells in the spleen compared to the protected lung niche due to its increased cellularity-- of the total numbers of Tet<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells recovered from lymphoid and lung tissue, two-thirds were found in the spleen and one-third in the protected lung niche (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Consistent with our results with CD4 T cells, Tet<sup>+</sup> flu-specific protected CD8 T cells were predominantly CD69<sup>+</sup> while Tet<sup>+</sup> cells among the labeled lung subset were CD69lo, as were all Tet<sup>+</sup> memory CD8 T cells in the spleen (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>).

The exclusive expression of CD69 and CD103 by protected but not labeled flu-specific CD8 T cells also indicate that the protected CD8 T cell subset exhibits key features of lung T<sub>RM</sub>. Taken together with the quantitative analyses in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>, the lack of CD69 and CD103 expression on labeled and splenic Tet<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells indicates that the majority of total influenza-specific memory CD8 T cells are circulating.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Lung niches for T<sub>RM</sub> are independent of lymphoid stores</title><p id="P15">The longterm maintenance of lung T<sub>RM</sub> enriched for influenza specificities in a spatially segregated niche, suggested that they could be independently maintained distinct from circulating and lymphoid populations.

This increased CD69 expression of flu-specific CD8 T cells in lung compared to spleen was observed in multiple donors analyzed (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref>), analogous to our results in flu-memory mice (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>). By contrast, CMV-specific CD8 T cells in lung and spleen exhibited comparable CD69 expression with 40&#x02013;50% CD69<sup>+</sup> in both tissues from multiple donors (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref>), indicating that circulating and resident memory populations may be generated from CMV infection. These results suggest that distinct viral pathogens can differentially promote the generation of T<sub>RM</sub> in specific sites, with flu biasing toward lung T<sub>RM</sub> generation and CMV infection generating comparable lymphoid and lung T<sub>RM</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S9"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P17">The extent to which T cell responses to virus infection are compartmentalized and whether they develop and/or preferentially persist at the infection site is not well understood. Here, we reveal new insights into how memory T cells are generated and maintained in the lung following respiratory infection with influenza virus. We demonstrate that the expansion and contraction of effector cells and persistence of memory T cells occurs in spatially-defined niches in the lung and are distinct from memory T cells in lymphoid tissues or spleen. Memory T cells in this protected niche were enriched for influenza-specific memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, exhibited upregulation of CD69 and CD11a, did not circulate, and were maintained independent of lymphoid stores&#x02014;indicating that they represent a new tissue-resident memory subset (T<sub>RM</sub>). Compartmentalization of influenza-specific memory T cells as lung T<sub>RM</sub> was also observed in humans, with flu-specific CD69<sup>+</sup> memory CD8 T cells enriched in lung compared to spleen from the same individual, and compared to memory CD8 T cells specific for a systemic virus. Together, our findings reveal a precise spatial organization virus-specific T cell memory into circulating and T<sub>RM</sub> subsets, with the relative proportion of each determined by the site of initial pathogen infection.</p><p id="P18">We demonstrate the existence of both resident and transient, circulating populations of T cells in the lungs using an <italic>in vivo</italic> antibody labeling approach which delineated T cells subsets that were labeled and protected from IV Ab. Although lung T cells were isolated from tissues perfused extensively to remove all visible traces of blood, and digested to liberate lymphocyte populations as done previously <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, over 90% of T cells in lungs of na&#x000ef;ve mice were accessible to circulation. This labeled population comprised both na&#x000ef;ve and memory subsets and disappeared rapidly when T cell egress from lymphoid tissue was blocked, suggesting an equilibrium between lymphoid and circulating lung T cells. By contrast, protected T cells were significantly present only in mice previously infected with influenza, had an effector-memory phenotype, were localized in clusters around airways and maintained independent of circulation and lymphoid egress. Previous studies have suggested that T<sub>EM</sub> in lungs and other non-lymphoid tissues are replenished during homeostasis from lymphoid stores, and central memory (T<sub>CM</sub>) subsets <sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. However, our results demonstrate that lung T<sub>RM</sub> cells, are not only spatially segregated, but also are maintained independent of lymphoid and circulating memory T cell populations. Moreover, lung T<sub>RM</sub> did not appear to be organized in lymphoid-like structures as in ectopic bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (BALT), which can be induced in acute respiratory infection <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. We therefore propose that lung T<sub>RM</sub> are terminally differentiated and irreversibly localized to a specific niche for longterm maintenance.</p><p id="P19">Lung T<sub>RM</sub>, as defined here, express phenotypic markers associated with T<sub>RM</sub> in other sites, including CD69 for both CD4 and CD8 T<sub>RM</sub>, and CD103 for CD8 T<sub>RM</sub>. CD69 and CD103 are also upregulated in memory CD8 T cells in the intestines and skin of human and mice <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, and in subsets of memory CD8 T cells in human lung <sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. CD69 is expressed at early times following T cell receptor (TCR) signaling <sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, or in response to proinflammatory cytokines, including Type I IFNs (IFN&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b2;), and TNF-&#x003b1; <sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Because CD69 is not expressed by flu-specific mouse or human memory T cells in spleen or lymph nodes (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), we propose that lung T<sub>RM</sub> are perceiving tonic signals via cytokines or TCR ligation that enable them to be maintained <italic>in situ</italic> in the lung. CD69 itself could play a functional role in retention in tissue sites due to reciprocal regulation of S1PR <sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. However, we found that lung T<sub>RM</sub> were generated and maintained in the protected niche following influenza infection of CD69-deficient mice (data not shown), suggesting that CD69 expression may act as an indicator of factors that govern the active compartmentalization of lung T<sub>RM</sub>, rather than through direct functional effects.</p><p id="P20">Our findings that memory T cells specific for influenza were predominantly lung T<sub>RM</sub> in both mice and humans suggest that the virus itself, including the site of infection and pathogenesis may determine the anatomic distribution and maintenance of memory T cells. Primary T cell responses to viral infection leading to the generation of memory T cells have been chiefly measured by quantitating Tetramer<sup>+</sup> T cells in spleen at different timepoints post-infection <sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Here, we were able to follow the process of expansion, contraction and memory formation of CD4 T cells by examining total cell numbers within a specific niche of the lung&#x02014;in unmanipulated polyclonal mice. Our findings also suggest that systemic pathogens may generate different type of tissue responses compared to respiratory pathogens. Consistent with this idea, Anderson, et al demonstrated that lung CD8 T<sub>RM</sub> are not generated by systemic infection with LCMV, but could develop if the infection was administered intranasally<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Our results showing that a significant proportion of human CMV-specific T cells expressed CD69 in the spleen (contrasting predominant CD69 expression by flu-specific memory T cells in the human lung), suggests that CMV may promote T<sub>RM</sub> populations in lymphoid tissues. Further analysis of specificities in different tissues, along with markers of T<sub>RM</sub> and <italic>in vivo</italic> labeling approaches in the context of diverse virus infections will enable a mapping of how virus-specific T cells are organized in the body.</p><p id="P21">Tissue compartmentalization of memory T cells may play a role in preserving the integrity of important memory T cell populations, which might otherwise be reduced by attrition within lymphoid tissues. An individual is exposed to multiple diverse viral pathogens over a lifetime, including acute viruses that are cleared by the immune system, chronic, persistent viruses which evade immune attack, and latent viruses which alternate between prolonged quiescent phases and acute infectious ones. Studies in mice infected with multiple viruses have shown that pre-existing memory T cell populations are quantitatively reduced and qualitatively altered in lymphoid organs in the face of infections with unrelated viruses <sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, and that chronic infections can impede the development of memory T cells to ongoing infections <sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. The retention of memory T cell populations at in specific niches may prevent loss of virus-specific memory T cells due to competition by newly formed memory T cells, and can also protect essential immune cells from the effects of virus-induced inflammation. This diversification of storage sites for immune memories may therefore be a key mechanism to enable maintenance of memory responses in the context of new or ongoing infections <sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P22">The identification of specific protective niches for the development and maintenance of memory T cells after respiratory viral infections has important implications for vaccine design. Focusing protective T cell responses at precise sites within tissues where infections occur, would be a key strategy for promoting protective immune responses, that could potentially improve immune efficacy over systemic approaches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S10"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="S11"><title>Mice</title><p id="P23">BALB/c mice (8&#x02013;16 weeks of age) (NCI Biological Testing Branch), and C57BL/6 mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY), were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC).
