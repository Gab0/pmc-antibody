However, the in vivo functional significance of the interaction between OX40 and its ligand, OX40L, is still unclear. To investigate the role of OX40L during in vivo immune responses, we generated OX40L-deficient mice and a blocking anti-OX40L monoclonal antibody, MGP34. OX40L expression was demonstrated on splenic B cells after CD40 and anti-immunoglobulin (Ig)M stimulation, while only CD40 ligation was capable of inducing OX40L on dendritic cells. OX40L-deficient and MGP34-treated mice engendered apparent suppression of the recall reaction of T cells primed with both protein antigens and alloantigens and a significant reduction in keyhole limpet hemocyanin&#x02013;specific IgG production. The impaired T cell priming was also accompanied by a concomitant reduction of both T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2 cytokines. Furthermore, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) derived from the mutant mice revealed an impaired intrinsic APC function, demonstrating the importance of OX40L in both the priming and effector phases of T cell activation. Collectively, these results provide convincing evidence that OX40L, expressed on APCs, plays a critical role in antigen-specific T cell responses in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>OX40 ligand</kwd><kwd>antigen-presenting cell function</kwd><kwd>T cell priming</kwd><kwd>OX40 ligand mutant mice</kwd><kwd>cytokine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>OX40, a membrane glycoprotein of the TNF receptor family originally identified as an activated T cell marker in the rat <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R1">1</xref>

<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R25">25</xref>, the expression kinetics of OX40L is still unclear. Therefore, we carried out a detailed analysis of OX40L expression by immunostaining with MGP34. Thymocytes and splenic lymphocytes freshly isolated from 5-wk-old C57BL/6 male mice failed to express OX40L (data not shown). Splenic T and B cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD40 plus anti-IgM Ab, respectively. Little expression of OX40L was observed on both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 (data not shown). However, in the B220<sup>+</sup> IgM<sup>+</sup> B cell population, stimulation with anti-CD40 plus anti-IgM Ab was able to induce expression of OX40L 2 d after the stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), and the expression persisted for up to 7 d. Stimulation with either anti-CD40 or anti-IgM Ab did not induce any expression of OX40L (data not shown). CD11c<sup>+</sup>33D1<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells freshly isolated from spleen cells expressed little, if any, OX40L; however, the OX40L expression was significantly induced 1 d after stimulation with anti-CD40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), but not by LPS (data not shown), and was sustained up until at least day 7. These results suggest that CD40 signaling is indispensable for OX40L expression on both B and dendritic cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Phenotypes of Lymphocytes and Dendritic Cells in OX40L-deficient Mice.</title><p>Flow cytometric analyses of thymocytes and splenocytes were performed to examine whether an absence of OX40L expression affects the development of lymphocytes and dendritic cells. OX40L-deficient mice did not display any apparent abnormality in the formation of lymphoid organ structures, in the numbers of T and B cells, and in the phenotypes of these cells as assessed by CD4 and CD8, or B220 and IgM expression on thymocytes and splenic lymphocytes (data not shown), respectively. No obvious difference in the ratio of CD11c<sup>+</sup>33D1<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells was observed between OX40L-deficient and wild-type spleens (data not shown). These results suggest that OX40L is not crucial in the early development of T, B, and dendritic cells.</p><p>To gain further insight into the role played by OX40L in APC functions, we examined the B and dendritic cells of OX40L-deficient mice in their expression of several molecules known to be involved in APC functions such as MHC class II antigen, CD40, CD80, and CD86. Although a previous report demonstrated that cross-linking of OX40L increased the expression level of these costimulatory molecules on human dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref>, similar basal levels of expression of these molecules were observed on unstimulated B and dendritic cells in both OX40L-deficient and wild-type mice (data not shown). Since CD40-stimulated B and dendritic cells are considered to be functional APCs, we next examined the expression patterns of these activated APC markers on B and dendritic cells upon stimulation with anti-CD40. All of these molecules were expressed among both CD40-stimulated B and dendritic cells derived from wild-type and OX40L-deficient mice (data not shown), suggesting that the absence of OX40L does not affect the CD40-induced expression of such molecules on APCs.</p><p>Proliferative responses of splenic T and B cells obtained from unimmunized wild-type or OX40L-deficient mice were next evaluated. Equal levels of proliferation were observed in both wild-type and mutant T cells in response to various T cell stimuli (anti-CD3, anti-CD28 plus anti-CD3, ConA, or PMA plus ionomycin). Similarly, in response to B cell stimuli such as LPS, anti-IgM, anti-CD40, or a combination of anti-IgM plus anti-CD40, B cell proliferative responses were indistinguishable in both populations (data not shown). These results suggest that the intrinsic potential of T and B cells to respond to antigens is preserved in OX40L-deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Impairment of T Cell Priming and Cytokine Production in OX40L-deficient Mice and MGP34-treated Mice.</title><p>To examine the in vivo effect of OX40L on antigen-specific T cell activation, we immunized OX40L-deficient or wild-type mice with KLH and tested their in vitro T cell recall proliferative response. A significantly reduced response was observed in OX40L-deficient mice, and the antigen dose&#x02013;response curve was shifted by several orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A). Similarly reduced responses were seen with two other protein antigens, hen egg lysozyme (HEL) and OVA, in OX40L-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> A). These results suggest that OX40L plays an important role in antigen-specific T cell priming. The reduced response in OX40L-deficient mice may be due to a defect at the level of the APCs, since the intrinsic potential of OX40L-deficient T cells in response to antigens is preserved (data not shown) and since OX40L expression was restricted to activated APCs but not T cells.</p><p>Next, we asked whether the dysfunction of OX40L-deficient APCs causing the reduced reaction in the T cells occurs during the initial in vivo T cell priming phase, during the secondary in vitro reaction, or possibly during both. Recall proliferative assays were performed using several configurations consisting of purified T cells and APCs derived from both OX40L-deficient and wild-type mice. Initially, KLH-primed CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells purified from OX40L-deficient or wild-type mice were examined for their recall reaction in the presence of the wild-type APCs. The response of OX40L-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was less than half of that observed among wild-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> B), indicating a key role for OX40L in antigen-specific T cell priming in vivo. Next, to evaluate the in vitro APC function during secondary T cell activation, KLH-primed CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from wild-type mice were incubated with APCs isolated from OX40L-deficient or wild-type spleen, and their recall proliferation was assayed. Interestingly, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation upon stimulation with the OX40L-deficient APCs was significantly reduced compared with wild-type APCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> C). These results revealed the intrinsic dysfunction of OX40L-deficient APCs in vitro. Taking the data together, OX40L is shown to be essential to fully activate antigen-specific T cell responses through OX40L-expressing APCs during both the priming and effector phases of T cell activation.</p><p>To rule out the possibility that the impairment of APC function could be caused by a mismatch of MHCs between T cells and APCs as a result of an insufficient backcross, we also examined whether C57BL/6 mice treated with MGP34, a blocking mAb for OX40L function, affects the in vivo T cell priming. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with KLH in a similar manner to the above experiment using OX40L-deficient mice and inoculated with either MGP34 or a control rat IgG at days 0, 2, 4, and 6 after immunization. In vitro proliferative recall responses of their lymph node cells were subsequently determined. Lymph node cells derived from the MGP34-administered mice showed suppressed recall reaction to KLH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> D) similar to that observed with the OX40L-deficient mice. Furthermore, we examined the in vitro recall reaction of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells purified from the KLH-primed lymph nodes of MGP34-treated mice in the presence of C57BL/6 APCs. We observed that the MGP34-treated mice had a significant reduction in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell recall reaction compared with the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> D), confirming the critical involvement of OX40L in antigen-specific T cell priming in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Cytokine Production in the Culture Supernatants Was Also Assayed by ELISA.</title><p>IFN-&#x003b3; production by both the OX40L-deficient and MGP34-treated lymph nodes was dramatically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref> E). The production levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 were also significantly lower than those of the control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. F</xref>), suggesting that the OX40&#x02013;OX40L system critically contributes to both the Th1 and Th2 responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Impairment of Antigen-specific Ab Production in OX40L-deficient Mice.</title><p>We next investigated the role of OX40L during the course of primary and secondary humoral immune responses against KLH, a well-known T cell&#x02013;dependent antigen. Sera from OX40L-deficient mice clearly exhibited reduced KLH-specific IgG Ab production in both primary and secondary humoral responses, among all murine IgG subclasses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). No significant difference in both primary and secondary IgM production was observed between wild-type and OX40L-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Similarly, in vivo administration of MGP34 mAb also inhibited the primary IgG, and not IgM, response to KLH (data not shown). In contrast, OX40L-deficient mice demonstrated normal IgM and IgG production specific for trinitrophenol (TNP) in both primary and secondary responses to TNP-LPS, a T cell&#x02013;independent antigen (data not shown), indicating the importance of the OX40&#x02013;OX40L interaction in T cell&#x02013;dependent humoral responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Alloantigen-specific CTL Response in OX40L-deficient and MGP34-treated Mice.</title><p>We examined the effect of OX40L on the induction of alloantigen-specific CTLs. Wild-type, OX40L-deficient, MGP34-treated, and control IgG&#x02013;treated C57BL/6 mice used as recipients were immunized with splenocytes derived from BALB/c mice. On day 5 after immunization, splenocytes from the recipient mice were used as effector cells in the cytotoxicity assay. Allospecific CTLs were induced in the control mice, whereas induction of such CTLs was significantly inhibited in both OX40L-deficient and MGP34-treated mice, suggesting an important involvement of OX40L in alloantigen-specific CTL response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Recently, OX40 has been highlighted as a new costimulatory molecule capable of activating T cells; however, the expression and function of its ligand OX40L are still unclear, particularly during in vivo immune responses. To elucidate the in vivo significance of OX40L, we produced OX40L-deficient mice and an antagonistic mAb specific for OX40L, MGP34. Using the two experimental tools, we revealed that OX40L expressed on APCs plays a key role on antigen-specific T cell initiation in vivo.</p><p>Several in vitro studies have demonstrated that OX40 stimulation enhances IL-4 expression and promotes T cell differentiation towards Th2 cells <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R34">34</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R35">35</xref>. In contrast to these studies, it has also been reported that in vivo administration of an OX40-IgG fusion protein, antagonistic for OX40, ameliorates Th1-associated diseases inflammatory bowel disease and EAE, and reduces transcripts for Th1 cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, IL-12, and IFN-&#x003b3; in the affected tissues <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref>. These results suggest that OX40&#x02013;OX40L interactions participate in enhancing both Th1 and Th2 responses during antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. This study clearly demonstrated that the lack of OX40&#x02013;OX40L interaction inhibits both of these responses during in vivo T cell priming. Since suppression of the Th1 response usually induces an increase in Th2 responses and vise versa, reduction of both Th1 and Th2 cytokine production in OX40L-deficient mice may reflect either hyporesponsiveness or anergy in the T cell response. A consequence of OX40 ligation on activated T cells is to increase their survival, as demonstrated by a recent publication <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R36">36</xref>. To examine whether OX40L is involved in the survival of primed memory T cells, wild-type and OX40L-deficient mice were stimulated with staphylococcal enterotoxin A and LPS to induce survival and expansion of V&#x003b2;3<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R36">36</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R37">37</xref>. Interestingly, the survival of these T cells is not significantly reduced in OX40L-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice (Murata, K., N. Ishii, L.C. Ndhlovu, and K. Sugamura, unpublished data). The increased survival of V&#x003b2;3<sup>+</sup> T cells by constitutive ligation of OX40 <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R36">36</xref> might not necessarily mean that OX40L deficiency induces apoptosis of the T cells. To fully explain the possible mechanism of hyporesponsiveness of the T cells in OX40-deficient mice, further examination will be necessary.</p><p>Further analysis of OX40L-deficient mice demonstrated impairment of both primary and secondary Ab production to KLH, a T cell&#x02013;dependent antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. B</xref>), as well as suppression of the alloantigen-specific CTL induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref> A) compared with wild-type mice. The suppressed Ab production to KLH is similar to a previous report showing that blockade of OX40&#x02013;OX40L interaction inhibited production of all of the IgG subclasses, but not IgM <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R17">17</xref>. Since KLH is known to be a T cell&#x02013;dependent antigen on Ab production, the impairment of Ab responses observed may also be due to suppressed T cell priming. However, our data here cannot exclude the possibility that OX40L signaling in B cells may be involved in Ab production or B cell differentiation. Indeed, a previous report demonstrated that ligation of OX40L led to an enhanced proliferation and Ig production of B cells <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R16">16</xref>. Furthermore, the suppressed alloantigen-specific CTL induction among OX40L-deficient mice may be a consequence of impaired CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help for CD8 responses. However, a direct role of OX40&#x02013;OX40L interaction on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells could exist, since OX40 has been reported to be expressed on activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in mice <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R5">5</xref> but not in rats.</p><p>OX40 expressed on activated T cells has been reported to be an effector molecule for costimulatory signal transduction upon interaction with OX40L on APCs in immune responses <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R24">24</xref>. OX40L expression was previously detected on activated B and dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R19">19</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R20">20</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R25">25</xref>. Since the sensitivity in detection of OX40L expression with soluble OX40 is at least 10 times lower than that with MGP34 mAb (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. C</xref>), MGP34 mAb is useful as a sensitive assay in determining the expression kinetics of OX40L. Using MGP34 mAb, we found that CD40-stimulated B and dendritic cells express OX40L within 2 d of stimulation and are able to sustain this expression beyond day 7. Since expression of CD40L, as a CD40 stimulant, is immediately induced on T cells after antigen stimulation, and since CD40 is constitutively expressed on APCs independent of antigen stimulation <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R38">38</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R39">39</xref>, our findings indicate that OX40L expression is presumably induced by CD40 stimulation 2 d after antigen challenge. On the other hand, OX40 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells has been reported to peak 48 h after TCR stimulation <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R24">24</xref>, which coincides with the onset of OX40L expression on CD40-stimulated APCs. This sequential expression of CD40&#x02013;CD40L and OX40&#x02013;OX40L suggests that the latter participates in the later phase of in vivo T cell priming.</p><p>Furthermore, we monitored the expression of CD80, CD86, and MHC class II molecules, known to be upregulated on B and dendritic cells after CD40 stimulation <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R25">25</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R40">40</xref>. Normal upregulation of the molecules was observed in OX40L-deficient APCs (data not shown), indicating that the OX40L deficiency may be responsible for the defective APC function in our study. As only partial suppression of recall response was observed, an OX40&#x02013;OX40L-independent system may come into play. Indeed, the synergistic potential of the CD28&#x02013;CD80&#x02013;CD86 and OX40&#x02013;OX40L systems in T cell activation has been suggested by the findings that in vitro T cell activation was markedly suppressed by a combination of both OX40L and CD28 blockade, rather than either alone <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R25">25</xref>. Other costimulatory systems such as CD28&#x02013;CD80&#x02013;CD86 may cooperatively work with the OX40&#x02013;OX40L system in antigen-specific T cell priming.</p><p>Since CD40 signaling is known to be upstream in the pathway for nuclear factor &#x003ba;B activation <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R41">41</xref>, our findings depicting the requirement of CD40 stimulation in the induction of OX40L expression are consistent with our previous report showing the downstream upregulation of the promoter activity of OX40L by nuclear factor &#x003ba;B activation <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R42">42</xref>.</p><p>Engagement of CD40 on APCs is well known to be an essential event for the differentiation of APCs to become functional in the priming of antigen-specific T cells <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R30">30</xref>
<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R43">43</xref>. Impairment of in vivo T cell priming in response to protein antigens in CD40L-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R30">30</xref> appears to correlate well with our data here with OX40L-deficient mice. In addition, we demonstrated that CD40 signaling is a critical trigger for inducing OX40L expression on APCs, and that CD40 signaling, required for proliferation of B cells and differentiation of APCs, is intact in OX40L-deficient mice as demonstrated by normal expression of known CD40-induced markers (data not shown). These results highlight the close relationship between CD40 stimulation and OX40L expression during the priming of T cells. We hypothesize that the impairment of T cell priming in CD40- or CD40L-deficient mice may be partially due to a failure of expression of OX40L on APCs. This plausible interplay of the two systems in the subsequent development of an effective immune response remains to be examined.</p><p>OX40 has been reported to be expressed on autoreactive T cells in several autoimmune disorders, including in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and graft-versus-host disease, and in the mouse model of multiple sclerosis, EAE <xref ref-type="bib" rid="R7">7</xref>

<xref ref-type="bib" rid="R14">14</xref>, suggesting that the OX40&#x02013;OX40L system may be involved in autoimmune reactions.

In this context, our findings using MGP34, antagonistic for OX40, also encourage us to examine the clinical usefulness of the blocking Ab in various autoimmune disorders.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. P.
