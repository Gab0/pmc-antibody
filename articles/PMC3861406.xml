In this study, we examine the effects of a non-myeloablative dose of total body irradiation on the ability of tumor-na&#x000ef;ve mice to respond to DNA vaccines against melanoma. We demonstrate that irradiation followed by lymphocyte infusion results in a dramatic increase in responsiveness to tumor vaccination, with augmentation of T cell responses to tumor antigens and tumor eradication. In irradiated mice, infused CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expand in an environment that is relatively depleted in regulatory T cells, and this correlates with improved CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell functionality. We also observe an increase in the frequency of dendritic cells displaying an activated phenotype within lymphoid organs in the first 24 hours after irradiation. Intriguingly, both the relative decrease in regulatory T cells and increase in activated dendritic cells correspond with a brief window of augmented responsiveness to immunization. After this 24 hour window, the numbers of dendritic cells decline, as does the ability of mice to respond to immunizations. When immunizations are initiated within the period of augmented dendritic cell activation, mice develop anti-tumor responses that show increased durability as well as magnitude, and this approach leads to improved survival in experiments with mice bearing established tumors as well as in a spontaneous melanoma model. We conclude that irradiation can produce potent immune adjuvant effects independent of its ability to induce tumor ablation, and that the timing of immunization and lymphocyte infusion in the irradiated host are crucial for generating optimal anti-tumor immunity. Clinical strategies using these approaches must therefore optimize such parameters, as the correct timing of infusion and vaccination may mean the difference between an ineffective treatment and successful tumor eradication.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by National Institutes of Health award numbers K08-CA10260 (MAP), PO1-CA33049 (MAP, MvdB, ANH), CA59350, CA58621, and CA47179 (ANH), T32-CA009512 (ADC), GM07739 (GAR), RO1-HL069929, RO1-CA107096, RO1-AI080455 and R01-HL095075 (MvdB).

The major challenges in developing effective vaccine therapy against cancer have been surmounting the barriers which prevent development of immune responses against self-antigens as well as mechanisms by which tumors can induce immune ignorance or tolerance [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As summarized by Klebanoff et al, results of most clinical trials of cancer vaccines have not shown a clinical benefit, despite the ability of many vaccines to produce measurable immune responses [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, clinical progress has recently been accelerating, with three Phase 3 clinical trials demonstrating a survival benefit with vaccine therapies directed against lymphoma, melanoma, and prostate cancer [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These results affirm that cancer vaccines have an emerging role to play in the management of malignancy.</p><p>One potential strategy to enhance cancer vaccines is not to build a better vaccine, but to instead utilize established vaccine approaches and combine them with strategies to improve the ability of individuals to respond to tumor immunization. Inducing lymphopenia with irradiation may be such an approach, having already been demonstrated to augment adoptive T cell therapy of cancer [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Dummer et al. [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] showed that the transfer of na&#x000ef;ve T cells into sublethally irradiated mice could slow tumor growth, through the expansion of polyclonal tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. A second group confirmed these results and also demonstrated an increase in the percentage of T cells expressing an activated CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>lo</sup> phenotype in irradiated mice [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Subsequent studies demonstrated increased availability of pro-survival and activating cytokines including IL-7 and IL-15 in the lymphopenic environment [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], while others have shown reduced numbers of regulatory T cells [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and a reduced threshold of activation and expansion of self-reactive T cell clones, which results in a beneficial anti-tumor response [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Given the well-established ability of irradiation to augment adoptive T cell therapies, in this study we have hypothesized that irradiation would similarly augment immune responses to a T cell cancer vaccine. Our results support this hypothesis. We observe increased frequency of tumor specific CD8+ T cells, augmented tumor protection and eradication in mice treated with combination therapy of irradiation, lymphocyte infusion, and vaccination when compared to single or dual-therapy. The enhancement is exquisitely sensitive to the timing of irradiation and vaccination. Efficacy correlates with the presence of activated dendritic cells that presumably prime the observed larger population of vaccine-generated tumor antigen specific CD8+ T cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Irradiation followed by na&#x000ef;ve lymphocyte infusion enhances T cell responses to tumor immunization</title><p>While lymphopenia has been demonstrated to enhance anti-tumor immune responses in a variety of settings, many of these prior studies utilized mice with genetic enhancement of T cell tumor specificity [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], or mice with genetically-induced absence of lymphocytes [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this study, we have focused on clinically relevant mouse models, making use of mice with normal T cell repertoires in all tumor experiments. We also chose to examine the effects of sublethal total body irradiation (6 Gy), a clinically translatable inducer of lymphopenia. Finally, we treated mice with DNA vaccines against melanoma that are murine analogues of those in clinical trials [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We began by studying the effects of irradiation on the efficacy of two different vaccines that immunize against the melanocyte differentiation antigens TRP2 and TRP1, respectively. We administered plasmid DNA encoding human TRP2 (hTRP2) [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or murine TRP1 mutated for optimized MHC class I binding and fused to the herpes simples virus type 2 VP22 protein (VP22-Opt-TRP1) [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Some mice received irradiation without or with lymphocyte infusion prior to immunizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>We found that irradiation prior to vaccination resulted in loss of responsiveness to immunizations, demonstrated by a reduction in T cell responses to peptide restimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) as well as an inferior ability to reject an intradermal challenge with murine B16 melanoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). However, rescue of irradiated mice with an infusion of unmanipulated splenocytes prior to vaccination resulted in enhanced T cell responses to immunization with both TRP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and VP22-Opt-TRP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Radiation and lymphocyte infusion also improved the ability of vaccinated mice to reject B16 melanoma with 100% tumor rejection, compared to 40% in unirradiated, vaccinated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Using congenic markers to distinguish residual lymphocytes that had survived irradiation from infusion-derived T cells, we found that vaccine-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after irradiation were all of infusion origin (data not shown). Stimulating T cells with varying peptide concentrations demonstrated that radiation resulted in enhanced numbers of both lower and higher affinity T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). </p><fig id="pone-0082496-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0082496.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Irradiation followed by lymphocyte infusion leads to augmented responses to tumor vaccination.</title><p>A) Schematic of experimental protocol. Mice were immunized with plasmid DNA against melanoma antigens for 3 weekly doses. One day prior to the first immunization some mice received 6 Gy total body irradiation (Rad) or irradiation followed by lymphocyte infusion (30&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> splenocytes from na&#x000ef;ve mice, RadL). B) Mice were treated as in A. After hTRP2 DNA immunizations, splenocytes were restimulated with TRP2<sub>181-188</sub> peptide (1&#x003bc;g/ml) and IFN&#x003b3; production from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was quantified by flow cytometry. n=3/group, results shown from one of two experiments with similar results.

After VP22-Opt-TRP1 DNA immunizations, splenocytes were restimulated with the indicated concentrations of TRP1<sub>455-463</sub> peptide [17] and IFN&#x003b3; production from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was quantified by flow cytometry. n=3/group.

It takes up to 6 weeks for T cell numbers to return to normal levels, with similar recovery rates for total T cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). At early time points, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were entirely of infusion origin, whereas beyond 3 weeks some CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were endogenously derived from the irradiated mouse (data not shown). In contrast, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly more radio-resistant, with only ~30% of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of infusional origin even at early time points (data not shown). We also evaluated numbers of regulatory T cells characterized by expression of CD4 and the transcription factor Foxp3. We found that all T cell subsets, including regulatory T cells, gradually recovered their numbers over 6 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). At early time points, however, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers displayed an accelerated pace of recovery compared to regulatory T cells, leading to a 3-fold increase in the ratio of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to regulatory T cells on the first day after infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As noted above, the antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were derived from the infusion, indicating this ratio may be critical to the early enhanced T cell responses we observed. Supporting a proliferative advantage of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we found that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells infused after irradiation upregulated components of the IL-15 receptor, including IL-15R&#x003b1; and CD122 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Given this evidence suggesting that effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may be receiving reduced regulatory signals following radiation, we asked if they would increase their acquisition of effector functions in the post-radiation environment. We utilized the Pmel-1 mouse, which overexpresses a CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell receptor (TCR) specific for the melanoma antigen gp100 [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Upon stimulation with gp100 peptide, IFN&#x003b3; is produced by only a very low frequency of na&#x000ef;ve Pmel T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Twenty days after transfer to an irradiated mouse, however, the majority of TCR transgenic cells produce IFN&#x003b3; upon ex vivo restimulation. We found that immunization with human gp100 plasmid DNA [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] is not necessary for this improved functionality, though the addition of immunization does lead to a further increase in the frequency of cytokine-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that irradiation followed by lymphocyte infusion augments the frequency of vaccine-generated tumor antigen specific, IFN&#x003b3;-producing CD8+ T cells. This enhanced effect correlates with a relative depletion of CD4+Foxp3+ T cells at the time of vaccination.</p><fig id="pone-0082496-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0082496.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Irradiation followed by lymphocyte infusion leads to marked T cell populations and increased frequency of IFNy+ tumor-antigen specific CD8+ T cells.</title><p>A) CD3, CD4 and CD8-expressing splenocytes were quantified by flow cytometry at the indicated time points following irradiation and lymphocyte infusion.

Naive Pmel splenocytes, and splenocytes isolated 20 days after infusion into irradiated animals +/- vaccination were restimulated with gp100<sub>25-33</sub> peptide (1&#x003bc;g/ml) and evaluated for staining with Pmel-specific tetramer and expression of IFN&#x003b3; by flow cytometry.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0082496.g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2.3"><title>Radiation results in a short-lived enhancement of dendritic cell numbers and phenotype, corresponding to a short window of enhanced responsiveness to tumor vaccination</title><p>In addition to evaluating T cell changes in response to radiation, we also examined effects on dendritic cells (DCs), which are major mediators of T cell activation in response to tumor vaccination [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The first day after irradiation, we observed a series of dramatic changes in dendritic cell numbers and phenotype. The frequency of splenic DCs (CD11c<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup>) was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and these DCs demonstrated higher expression of the costimulatory molecule CD86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) as well as CCR7 and IL-15R&#x003b1; (data not shown). We found similar results in inguinal lymph nodes (data not shown). In addition, in inguinal lymph nodes we observed an abrupt increase in the percentage of skin-derived DCs, which can be identified by a higher level of MHCII expression [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. By 24 hours following irradiation, the percentage of skin-derived DCs increased greater than 10-fold. This was followed by a rapid decrease to a level that remained above normal for an additional 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This influx of migratory DCs resulted in a higher ratio of MHCII<sup>high</sup> to MHCII<sup>intermediate</sup> DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Migratory DCs have been previously shown to be superior in mediating T cell activation [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Together, these results suggest that radiation may mediate enhanced responses to tumor vaccination via improvements in antigen-presentation. However, by day 3, these changes had largely normalized and by day 5 following irradiation, DCs were nearly undetectable in peripheral lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>Given the short-lived augmentation of dendritic cell numbers and activation phenotype, we evaluated whether the window of enhanced responsiveness to vaccination after irradiation is similarly short-lived. We treated mice with radiation followed by lymphocyte infusion, and initiated immunizations at varying time points thereafter. Mice vaccinated starting one day after treatment demonstrated enhanced T cell responses and tumor rejection, similar to what we had observed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g003">Figures 3C and D</xref>). Interestingly, we found that delaying the start of vaccinations to either 3 days or 7 days after treatment led to a time-dependent loss of ability to respond to vaccination, with blunted T cell responses and impaired tumor rejection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g003">Figures 3C and 3D</xref>).

We next examined the persistence of the augmented T cell responses following irradiation, infusion, and vaccination. We evaluated T cell responses of mice 5, 12, 19, and 35 days after completion of immunizations. We found that treating with radiation and lymphocyte infusion prior to vaccination led to increased T cell responses up to 19 days after the final immunization, though by day 35 these had waned to levels similar to unirradiated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). These results suggest that radiation and lymphocyte infusion not only increase peak T cell responses to immunization (day 5), but also led to a continued elevation in T cell responses, which lasted for several weeks. We hypothesized that this enhanced persistence of T cell responses would lead to improved rejection of tumor challenges administered at later time points after final immunization.

We irradiated and vaccinated mice bearing 3-day-established B16 tumors, and one day later began immunizing with VP22-Opt-TRP1 plasmid DNA. We found that, similar to tumor-na&#x000ef;ve mice, tumor-bearing mice develop improved responses to tumor vaccination following radiation and lymphocyte infusion, with enrichment of tumor-specific T cells in both the spleen and tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, when mice were followed for overall survival, we found that vaccination with VP22-Opt-TRP1 alone failed to cure mice bearing 3-day B16 tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), while the combination of vaccine, irradiation and lymphocyte infusion led to cures in 20% of mice (p=0.005, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to better evaluate the potential of radiation as a cancer vaccine adjuvant in a clinically relevant model, we tested the efficacy of DNA vaccination in a spontaneous murine model of melanoma. Tg(Grm1)EPv-transgenic mice carry the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (Grm1) under the control of the melanocyte-specific dopachrome tautomerase (Dct, Trp2) promoter. These mice develop melanocytic hyperproliferation at hairless regions that progresses to distinct primary melanomas, with a latency of 4&#x02013;6 months. We treated mice beginning at 8-12 weeks of age, and found that vaccination alone with VP22-Opt-TRP1 produced only partial protection in these mice, with 30% of mice succumbing to development of melanomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Radiation and lymphocyte infusion, however, improved the response to vaccination resulting in 100% tumor-free survival in this spontaneous melanoma model, which has a high penetrance without treatment. We also noted that mice vaccinated following radiation and lymphocyte infusion developed a higher degree of autoimmune-mediated vitiligo, compared to mice that were vaccinated without pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082496-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Prior studies have demonstrated that irradiation followed by lymphocyte infusion can enhance immune cell therapies against tumors [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In many of these studies, tumor antigens were either not well-defined or were genetically over-expressed foreign antigens. Also, tumor cell inoculation usually occurred prior to irradiation, leading to a potential contribution from immunogenic tumor cell death. In the current study, we sought to carefully define the mechanisms by which irradiation can act as a cancer vaccine adjuvant independent of immunogenic, irradiation-induced tumor cell death in a clinically relevant mouse model. We chose to immunize with DNA vaccines that elicit well-defined responses against tissue-restricted self-antigens, utilizing mice that had normal polyclonal T cell repertoires in tumor experiments, and evaluated responses against a pre-clinical mouse melanoma model.</p><p>We found that irradiation prior to vaccination resulted in enhanced responsiveness to plasmid DNA immunization against self-antigens, both in terms of quantified T cell responses and rejection of tumor cells. We demonstrated that several requirements are critical for the adjuvant effects of irradiation. First, a lymphocyte infusion following irradiation is necessary, because irradiation alone without lymphocyte infusion resulted in loss of responsiveness to DNA immunization. Our experiments utilizing congenic markers corroborated the importance of the lymphocyte infusion by demonstrating that T cells responding to vaccination were all derived from the infused lymphocytes and not from the irradiated mouse [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A recent clinical trial in patients with multiple myeloma also demonstrated the importance of lymphocyte infusion prior to immunization with a pneumococcal vaccine following myeloablative conditioning with melphalan [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Second, we found that the timing of immunizations was also crucial in determining whether irradiation could augment immune responses. Initiation of immunizations within 24 hours of irradiation led to augmented responses, but by 72 hours, the responsiveness of the immune system had waned to normal (unirradiated) levels. This was unlikely to be due to expansion of regulatory T cells or recovery from lymphopenia following irradiation, since our data demonstrate that depletion of all T cell subsets, including regulatory T cells, persists for up to 6 weeks following irradiation. Our results raise the intriguing possibility that enhancement of dendritic cell function following irradiation may in part account for the increased responsiveness of CD8+ T cells to vaccine. We observed a brief period of dendritic cell activation and recruitment following irradiation which rapidly returns to baseline by 72 hours after irradiation. If immunizations were initiated 24 hours after irradiation, then mice developed augmented acquisition of CD8+ T cell effector function, suggesting that priming by dendritic cells is enhanced in this time period. We previously demonstrated protein expression as early as 8 hours after DNA administration to the skin using the gene gun [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While the mechanism of increased DC migration to skin-draining lymph nodes after ionizing radiation remains unclear, acute radiation toxicity of the skin is associated with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, CCL4, CXCL10, and CCL2 [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Of the major groups of skin-derived DCs, both the epidermal LCs and the dermal DCs have been found to be depleted from the skin following local irradiation [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our data identifying an increase in skin-derived DCs in the inguinal lymph nodes 24 hours following irradiation suggests that these skin DCs have indeed migrated to the draining lymph nodes, rather than dying off within the skin. Our data therefore suggest that early immunization allows for antigen uptake by enriched and activated DCs that can more effectively present to the immune system. Interestingly, our data also show that the immune advantages conferred by irradiation do not result from an increase in higher affinity T cells but rather an increase in either recruitment or proliferation of low-affinity T cells. Thus enhanced antigen-presentation may indeed be playing a dominant role in augmenting immune responses by improving activation of low-affinity T cells.</p><p>In contrast to DCs, T cell populations were initially depleted after irradiation and then gradually recovered over 6 weeks. It has been suggested that CD8+ T cells may expand more rapidly than regulatory T cells in the lymphopenic host and that this may result in enhanced effector function [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In our model, we found that numbers of CD4+Foxp3+ T cells and CD8+ T cells are both significantly depleted after irradiation. In the first few days after irradiation, however, CD8+ T cells recovered more robustly, leading to a dramatic increase in the ratio of donor-derived CD8+ T cells to CD4+Foxp3+ T cells. This may be due to an augmentation in CD8+ T cells responsiveness to IL-15 following irradiation; indeed, we observed an upregulation of the components of the IL-15 receptor including IL-15R&#x003b1; and CD122. One potential mechanism for increased expression of IL-15 receptor components in lymphopenia may be through reduced TGF&#x003b2; signaling, since TGF&#x003b2; has been known to modulate expression of CD122 [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. IL-15 signaling has been shown to promote CD8+ T cell survival in the lymphopenic environment [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Our results corroborate studies in both mouse models [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and clinical studies [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which indicate that the effector to regulatory T cell ratio can be a useful predictor for development of effective anti-tumor immune responses. </p><p>Our data suggest that irradiation can augment immune responses to cancer vaccines that already contain additional immune adjuvants. In our experiments we utilized DNA vaccines, which are bacterial plasmids and thus include CpG motifs that signal through TLR9 [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In our tumor models, however DNA vaccination alone provided only partial protection which could be enhanced be pre-treating mice with radiation and lymphocyte infusion prior to vaccination. Our data thus indicate that irradiation can act as an immune adjuvant even in the presence of another adjuvant, such as CpG.</p><p>While our study addressed tumor-independent immune effects of irradiation, tumor-specific immune effects of irradiation have been demonstrated by others. These include antigen release and cytokine production, which results in increases in tumor infiltration by lymphocytes and enhanced anti-tumor immune responses [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. External beam radiation applied to tumors can augment effects of vaccines [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], as well as other immunomodulating strategies, including CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. One study demonstrated the generation of tumor-specific T cell immune responses after irradiation [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and showed that these cells affect not only the locally irradiated area, but also distant metastatic sites. Recent clinical data suggests that this can occur in humans as well [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The response seems to depend on the dose and frequency of radiation (single dose versus fractionated) [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thus, more than a single mechanism likely accounts for the immunostimulatory effect of irradiation.</p><p>We sought to evaluate the clinical potential of utilizing irradiation as an immune adjuvant. We found that irradiation and lymphocyte infusion led to not only higher peak responses, but also improved persistence of immune responses, measured by both T cell stimulation assays and tumor challenge experiments. Importantly, we found that radiation and lymphocyte infusion acts as a tumor vaccine adjuvant in both the absence and presence of tumor. Interestingly, our data suggest that the presence of aberrant melanocyte proliferation may be important in generating lasting anti-tumor immunity. While wild-type mice generate robust T cell responses to DNA vaccination that are further enhanced when mice are pre-treated with radiation and lymphocyte infusion, immune responses fade over time and mice become susceptible to tumor challenges at later time points. In a spontaneous model of murine melanoma, however, radiation followed by lymphocyte infusion and vaccination produces lasting protection against spontaneous development of melanomas. It is possible that melanocyte hyperproliferation generates a broad immune response against a variety of antigens, and that in this setting generating an immune response against single self-antigen can lead to lasting protection.</p><p>In summary, irradiation in an appropriate time frame can act as a potent immune adjuvant for DNA immunization against self-derived differentiation antigens, leading to augmented anti-tumor immunity. Essential requirements that we have identified include lymphocyte infusion to rescue immune responsiveness and early initiation of vaccination. Our data raise the hypothesis that transient enhancement of dendritic cell function may be responsible for the augmented CD8+ T cell response to vaccination. These results have important implications for the design of clinical trials utilizing combination strategies of radiation therapy and immunotherapy in patients with cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Mice and adoptive transfer</title><p>C57BL/6J (B6, H-2b) and congenic B6 Thy1.1 mice (6-8 week-old females) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).
