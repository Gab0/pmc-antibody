Three sequential stages of DC maturation (immature, mature, and apoptotic) were defined and characterized. Immature DC (stage 1) had low expression of costimulatory molecules, highly organized cytoskeleton, focal adhesion plaques, and slow motility; accordingly, they were very efficient in antigen uptake and processing of soluble proteins. Further, at this stage most of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules were within cytoplasmic compartments consistent with a poor allostimulatory capacity. Bacteria or cytokines were very efficient in inducing progression from stage 1 towards stage 2 (mature). Morphological changes were observed by confocal analysis including depolymerization of F-actin and loss of vinculin containing adhesive structures which correlates with acquisition of high motility. Antigen uptake and presentation of native protein antigen was reduced. In contrast, presentation of immunogenic peptides and allostimulatory activity became very efficient and secretion of IL-12 p75 was detectable after antigen presentation. This functional DC maturation ended by apoptotic cell death, and no reversion to the immature phenotype was observed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Dendritic cells (DC)<sup>1</sup> comprise a family of professional APC responsible for the activation of naive T cells and the generation of primary T cell responses (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). To fully perform these functions, DC residing in non-lymphoid tissues need to be activated and to initiate a differentiation process. This maturation of DC is characterized by profound changes in MHC class II distribution, antigen-processing capacity (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), expression of costimulatory molecules (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and a marked rearrangement of adhesion molecules that is likely to allow DC migration to lymphoid organs (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). DC maturation should be critically controlled by microenvironmental signals. However, limited knowledge exists about the factors and the mechanisms regulating DC cell cycle, life span, and functional activity. Cytokines secreted in a paracrine (e.g., GM-CSF, TNF&#x003b1;) or autocrine (TNF&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;) fashion control DC movements (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), survival (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and APC activity (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), but the fine biochemical mechanisms underlying these effects are not known. Once DC have interacted with T cells, they complete the differentiation process, which is believed to terminate by apoptosis.</p><p>Several groups have succeeded in generating large numbers of functional DC/Langerhans cells (LC) in both the murine or the human system by treating DC precursors with GM-CSF alone or in combination with other growth factors (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, such DC could be propagated only for limited time periods, i.e., up to 3 mo. More recently, growth factor-dependent long-term DC lines from mouse fetal or newborn skin have been established (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Nevertheless, although these lines possess the properties of DC precursors and maintain an immature phenotype they cannot be induced to mature in vitro (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Here we present evidence that MHC class II&#x02013;positive growth factor&#x02013;dependent immature DC, derived from adult mice spleen, can be driven in vitro to proliferate over more than one year of continuous culture. Proliferation and survival of such immature cells are strictly dependent upon the presence of exogenous GM-CSF and fibroblast-derived growth factors. Long-term DC preserve an immature phenotype but various activating signals, such as living bacteria or cytokines, promote full maturation. During this process, class II molecules are exported at the cell surface, adhesion/ costimulatory molecules are upregulated, the actin-based cytoskeleton is rearranged, and cell motility is increased. Furthermore, only matured cells are able to activate antigen-specific T cells and to produce IL-12 p75, a key cytokine skewing the response towards a Th1 polarization.</p><p>Using this novel in vitro differentiation system, kinetic stages of DC maturation and apoptotic cell death could be established. On the basis of the results of this study and previous data from the literature, a model of DC maturation checkpoints and sequential events is proposed.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Animals.</title><p>Mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Calco, Como, Italy).

Anti-IL-12 antibodies (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) were kindly provided by Dr. M.K. Gately (Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, NJ). After overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C, bound peroxydase was detected by 3,3&#x02032;-5,5&#x02032;-tetramethylbenzidine (Fluka Chemical Co.), and adsorbance read at 450 nm with an automated microplate ELISA reader (MR5000; Dynatech). IL-12 p75 was quantified from two to three titration points using standard curves generated by purified recombinant mouse IL-12 and results expressed as cytokine concentration in pg/ml. Detection limit was 10 pg/ml.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="4"><title>Generation of Long-term Immature DC from Cultured Mouse Spleen Cells.</title><p>DC were derived from spleen cell suspensions cultured in medium supplemented with fibroblast supernatant, known to support the growth of skin DC (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), together with GM-CSF, a cytokine essential for DC growth.</p><p>Typical adherent aggregates of DC with fine membrane projections were visible at the periphery of the clusters on day 10&#x02013;12 and in the following days both cell clusters and DC increased in number and size. The first passage was performed around days 12&#x02013;14 using EDTA treatment to leave behind only the strongly adherent cells. After 10&#x02013;12 wk, cultures consisted of single adherent cells with fine cytoplasmic protrusions, adherent cell clusters and cells growing in suspension, some of which had veiled morphology. Cell growth could be continuously maintained (at least over one year) but was strictly dependent on the presence in the culture medium of GM-CSF and fibroblast supernatant (R1 medium). Growth factor deprivation led to cell growth arrest and cell death (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). DNA fragments in apoptotic cells were visualized by TUNEL staining, starting from 24&#x02013;48 h after deprivation, with a number of viable cells decreasing to less than 10% after 1 wk (data not shown). After 6 mo of continuous growth this long-term bulk culture of spleen DC was named D1. The method is highly reproducible given that additional long-term growth factor&#x02013; dependent DC lines have been independently generated using the same approach.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>D1 Cells Preserve the Phenotype of Immature DC, and Cannot Be Converted to Macrophages in Response to M-CSF.</title><p>Surface markers expressed in D1 cultures included CD11c (N418), Fc&#x003b3;II/III receptor (2.4G2), and F4/80; NLDC145 was expressed only in &#x0223c;10% of the cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The majority of the cells expressed moderate levels of membrane class II molecules (I-A<sup>int</sup>), but 20% of the cells expressed high levels (I-A<sup>bright</sup>) of class II molecules. The same staining pattern, albeit at lower fluorescence intensity, was observed for B7.2. Double-color flow cytometric analysis of unstimulated cells showed that I-A<sup>bright</sup> cells were those expressing higher levels of B7.2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). D1 were positive for all class I antigens (H-2 K, D), and for the costimulatory CD40 and B7.1 molecules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Adhesion and homing receptors such as CD11a (LFA-1), CD11b (Mac-1), CD54 (ICAM-1), and VLA-4 were highly expressed, as well as the heat stable antigen (HSA/J11d). In contrast, granulocytes, T and B cell markers were negative (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), whereas c-kit and Fas ligand were expressed, although at low levels. Interestingly, the M-CSF receptor c-fms (CD115) was also expressed but experiments aimed at converting the D1 cells to a macrophage phenotype by adding rM-CSF in culture, showed that substitution of rGM-CSF (or R1 supernatants) with M-CSF (or M-CSF supplemented with fibroblast supernatant) in the culture medium, reduced the D1 cell viability to 15%, in 3 d. Growth arrest was observed in the remaining viable cells, which survived only for a few weeks. Altogether these results indicate that mouse spleen DC, grown in the culture conditions listed above, preserve the phenotype characteristic of immature DC.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Phenotypic Maturation of DC Can Be Induced by Microbes, LPS or Cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, but not IL-6.</title><p>Floating cells with veils and dendrites were seen in unstimulated cultures only at low frequency and most of the cells appeared to be loosely adherent to the surface of the culture dish.

I-A, B7.2, CD40, and ICAM-1 molecules were strongly upregulated by all stimuli, whereas expression of the same surface molecules did not change after treatment with 10 ng/ml IL-6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>

Analysis of surface I-A expression after 6 d of culture showed that previously sorted I-A<sup>int</sup> cells included again a small population of I-A<sup>bright</sup> cells (data not shown). Because previous experiments showed that LPS increased surface expression of I-A molecules, culture medium was examined for traces of endotoxin content as a possible explanation for this apparently spontaneous in vitro maturation. Indeed, a very low amount (&#x0223c;0.3 ng/ml) of endotoxin was detected in the standard R1 culture medium, thus suggesting that the observed spontaneous DC maturation may be due to LPS.</p><p>Sorted I-A<sup>bright</sup> cells replated in culture displayed a morphology similar to those treated with TNF&#x003b1;, including formation of floating aggregates. However, I-A<sup>bright</sup> cells could not be propagated in culture, and &#x0003e;90% of these sorted cells could not be rescued after 6 d of culture. Neither addition of TNF&#x003b1; nor addition of the R1 supernatant improved the viability of I-A<sup>bright</sup> sorted cells (data not shown). This finding indicates that DC maturation is an irreversible process and that when particular checkpoints are passed, maturation can not be reverted. This is also suggested by the impossibility to propagate long-term DC purified on the basis of high MHC class IIexpression.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Redistribution of MHC Class II Molecules and Their Export to the Cell Surface Membrane Correlates with DC Maturation.</title><p>Confocal microscopy after staining with anti-class II mAbs revealed that unstimulated cells express high amounts of class II molecules. However, consistent with the results of FACS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> analysis, most of them were not at the cell surface but were contained in discrete intracellular vesicular compartments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>a</italic>). A minor cell population, (&#x0223c;15%), exhibited a more pronounced DC morphology and were stained more strongly at the cell surface and less intracellularly (not shown). To better define the characteristics of these intracellular class II positive compartments, double staining with anti-H2-M&#x003b2; antibody was performed. Class II positive vesicles appear to colocalize with H2-M&#x003b2;-positive vesicles in immature D1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>a</italic>, yellow color due to the superimposition of green class II&#x02013;containing vesicles and red H2-M&#x003b2;-containing vesicles). These results indicate that mature class II molecules, exported from the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network, are mostly located in a compartment similar to the MIIC, and to the prelysosomal compartments defined in B cells. In contrast, maturation of D1 cells with TNF&#x003b1;, induced a redistribution of class II molecules at the cell surface. Although intracellular class II staining was still observed no colocalization with H2-M&#x003b2; molecules was visualized (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>
<italic>b</italic>, green class II&#x02013;containing vesicles and red H2-M&#x003b2;-containing vesicles do not colocalize). This result suggests that DC maturation involves a redistribution of MHC class II molecules: fully mature D1 cells have class II molecules expressed mostly at the cell surface and only partially in intracellular compartments.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Rearrangement of Microfilaments and of Microtubules Correlates with DC Functional Maturation.</title><p>Cell migration requires a coordinate series of events that include a sequential rearrangement of both surface adhesion molecules and of the actin-based cytoskeleton. Immature D1 cells are characterized by numerous membrane expansions that terminate in adhesive structures displayed in the panel by black arrows (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>
<italic>a</italic>). Highly organized vinculin can be visualized in the adhesive structures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>

Unstimulated D1 cells shown subcortical actin aggregates, as visualized by phalloidin staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>

In contrast to the disassembly of the actin filaments organization, microtubules are only partially affected by TNF&#x003b1; treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <italic>g</italic> and <italic>h</italic>). The centriolar organization of microtubules appear to be more prominent after TNF&#x003b1; treatment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>The Ability of DC to Become Highly Mobile Correlates with their Functional Maturation.</title><p>Migratory properties are essential to DC function and can be followed in vitro by timelapse videomicroscopy.

However the situation may be different for nominal class II&#x02013;restricted protein antigens. Immature murine DC were in fact reported to present native protein antigens better than shortterm cultured DC (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). To address this issue, I-A<sup>bright</sup> and I-A<sup>int</sup> sorted cells were compared for their capacity to process and present native OVA or OVA peptides to the specific T hybridoma BO97.10.

In order to exert this property, DC need to reach a stage of functional maturation which is not met by immature DC.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>DC originating from bone marrow cells, which include CFU-DC that yield homogeneous DC colonies under particular cytokine conditions (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), enter the blood as progenitors and colonize, from the blood stream, lymphoid, and non-lymphoid tissues. Spleen DC were identified for the first time by Steinman in 1979 (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and were shown to be the predominant stimulators in the MLR reaction (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In spite of two decades of studies, the DC differentiation process remains an unsolved issue and many key questions are still under investigation. Are DC progenitors predetermined to differentiate into fully mature DC and is this commitment irreversible? What are the functions that correlate with the various DC differentiation stages? To address some of these questions, the differentiation potential of immature spleen DC was investigated with the purpose to reproduce in vitro the process of DC differentiation and define the checkpoints of the so-called DC maturation.</p><p>We established an homogeneous immature DC population driven to proliferate for as long as growth factors are provided. These long-term, growth factor&#x02013;dependent immature DC cells could be induced to mature in vitro, upon activation with a number of regulatory signals, into terminally differentiated DC. Using this defined model system, we identified three sequential stages of the DC maturation: stage 1 is adherent and characterized by a high proliferation rate, a low motility, and a highly organized cytoskeleton. The expression of MHC class II molecules seems to be mainly restricted to cytoplasmic vesicles positive for H2-M&#x003b2; molecules thus indicating that the majority of the class II molecules are located in a compartment similar to the MHC. CD40 and B7.2 costimulatory molecules are expressed at low level. Furthermore, these immature DC are inefficient in allostimulatory activity and are unable to secrete IL-12 but have a high capacity of antigen uptake and processing.</p><p>Progression from stage 1 towards stage 2 requires signaling, and this can be achieved using living bacteria, LPS or cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1; or IL-1&#x003b2; but not IL-6. Stage 2, which is induced in few hours and is completed after one day, is characterized by low proliferative rate, high motility, and complete depolarization of actin cytoskeleton with loss of adhesiveness. In addition, mature DC rearrange the cell surface expression of receptors and molecules: MHC class II, CD-40, and B7.2 molecules become highly expressed on the cell surface and this may correlate with the ability to produce IL-12.</p><p>Interestingly, intracellular class II&#x02013;containing compartments appear to be different from the ones observed in immature D1 cells, given that colocalization with the H2-M&#x003b2; molecule is no longer detectable. In contrast, mature DC disassemble actin-based cytoskeleton, lose adhesion plaques, and become inefficient in protein antigen uptake and presentation. However, allostimulatory activity and peptide presentation remain very efficient.</p><p>Most of these cells will spontaneously progress towards stage 3 where they completely stop proliferation. In agreement with this hypothesis we also found that MHC class II<sup>high</sup> sorted D1 cells, if recultured after sorting, enter stage 3, characterized by cell growth arrest and final cell death by apoptosis. In contrast, sorting and reculture of the MHC class II<sup>int</sup> D1 subpopulation leads to the development of a population which resembles the initial bulk D1 cells. Thus, the D1 bulk population contains self-renewal progenitors from which both immature and mature DC can be easily generated.</p><p>All the stages of this sequential maturation are relevant for experimental therapeutics and transplantation biology. In fact, the growth of heterogeneous bulk DC populations or selected immature DC, may be more suitable for experimental therapeutics than the growth of selected fully mature DC undergoing terminal differentiation. We have shown that native proteins are better presented by immature DC whereas peptides are better presented by mature DC. Therefore, design of therapeutical approaches based either on protein or peptide DC loading should carefully consider the stage of DC maturation; to select the most suitable DC subpopulation the purification procedures should be well defined as well as the culture conditions in order to preserve either immature or mature DC. Which factors preserve the self-renewal potential of the progenitors and what prevents the full maturation of the D1 cells (in the culture conditions described above) are still open questions, presently under investigation.</p><p>Our data concerning the process of DC maturation are in agreement with a number of studies (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) but are in contrast with some others. In particular, the current view of a full interconversion between mature DC and macrophages (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) should be carefully examined at the single cell level using homogeneous cell populations, such as the D1 cells. The DC phenotype could not be reversed into a macrophage one, indicating that once the bulk DC population is committed to the DC phenotype this process is irreversible. When the purification procedures can not separate shared precursors (likely to be in common with monocytes) the lineage commitment is more difficult to be observed.</p><p>What stimuli induce full differentiation of mouse DC? In this study we provide the first evidence that TNF&#x003b1; plays a crucial role in mouse DC maturation, as previously reported in human monocyte-derived (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and bone marrow&#x02013;derived DC (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), as well as in LC (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We also showed that IL-1&#x003b2; induces phenotypical DC maturation, most likely through a paracrine induction of TNF&#x003b1; expression, as shown in LC (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Living bacteria and bacterial cell constituents are also strong inducers of full DC maturation, including upregulation of the costimulatory molecules B7.2 and CD40. It is likely that in vivo, the first signals inducing DC maturation are delivered by microbes since we previously showed a paracrine induction of TNF&#x003b1; expression in DC infected with Gram<sup>+</sup> and Gram<sup>&#x02212;</sup> bacteria (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Thus, TNF&#x003b1; is most likely a signal 2 for sequential DC maturation, whereas pathogens represent a signal 1.</p><p>In addition to its function in DC morphological maturation, TNF&#x003b1; also promotes DC emigration (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) from tissues such as skin, intestine, heart, and kidney (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The non-lymphoid DC need to move on to the regional lymph nodes in order to encounter naive T cells and elicit primary immune responses. Thus, the migratory properties are an essential component of the DC function. In this report we also provide the first evidence that TNF&#x003b1; is able to induce a complete rearrangement of the actin-based cytoskeleton in DC.</p><p>This actin disassembly could explain the decreased macropinocytosis ability of mature DC as proposed in other systems (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The disassembly of actin filaments upon TNF&#x003b1; treatment is correlated with a loss of endocytic capacity in DC. Macropinocytosis represents one of the most efficient antigen uptake mechanism in DC but requires the integrity of polymerized actin filaments; it is likely that DC maturation shuts off the micropynocytic pathway by inducing actin disassembly. The modification of the actin cytoskeleton is also relevant in the acquisition of migration properties of mature DC. TNF&#x003b1; treatment induces cell detachment and formation of an organized centriolar array of microtubules which are likely to be highly dynamic (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Membrane expansions of mature DC, which occur in response to the cytoskeleton remodeling, also appear highly dynamic: vinculin containing adhesive structures disappear and the cells acquire migratory properties. By time-lapse videomicroscopy we were able to show the highly enhanced motility of the TNF&#x003b1;-activated D1 cells. Because F-actin seems to be mainly disorganized, whereas microtubules are still highly organized, our data indicate a role for microtubules in determining DC movements. In vivo, motility should unable DC to encounter T cells and the final outcome should be T cell activation and Th1/Th2 polarization. It has been proposed that DC maturation continues until DC-T cell interaction occurs (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) but in the D1 model mature DC were driven to terminal differentiation even in the absence of T cells. On the other hand, interaction of DC with T cells was essential for IL-12 production (this study and 36). Interestingly, immature DC fail to produce IL-12 p75 either upon stimulation with heat treated <italic>S. aureus</italic> and IFN&#x003b3; or after activation with antigen-specific T cell hybridoma. In contrast, IL-12 p75 secretion is readily detectable in TNF&#x003b1;treated DC after interaction with antigen-specific T cells. This result indicates that the feedback between T cells and DC is dependent on TCR-peptide/class II interaction and this property is reached at stage 2 of functional maturation. These data also indicate that DC may play a major role in polarizing the immune response towards the Th1 pathway.</p><p>The model system analyzed in this study reproduces DC differentiation in vitro from the very early events towards terminal maturation. A fine molecular analysis of each step of functional DC maturation can now be undertaken.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank Giampiero Girolomoni for critical readings, Domenico Delia for cell sorting, and Carmela Mutini, Fabrizio Manca and Daniele Severino for time-lapse videomicroscopy.
