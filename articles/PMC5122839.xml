Here, IL-2 Ab Cx was explored as a therapeutic agent to reduce joint inflammation induced by chikungunya virus, an alphavirus causing debilitating joint disease globally. Virus-infected mice treated with IL-2 Ab Cx exhibited exacerbated joint inflammation due to infiltration of highly activated CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cells (Teffs). Virus infection led to upregulation of CD25 on the Teffs, rendering them sensitive towards IL2 Ab Cx. Ready responsiveness of Teffs to IL-2 was further demonstrated in healthy human donors, suggesting that the use of IL-2 Ab Cx in humans is not suitable. Changes in IL-2 sensitivity during active virus infection could change the responsive pattern towards the IL-2 Ab Cx, resulting in the expansion of pro-inflammatory rather than anti-inflammatory responses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Recruitment and activation of the immune system in response to virus infections result in the release of potent cytokines and cytotoxic molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.

Thus, immunotherapy could provide a targeted treatment for this inflammatory disease. One mechanism used by the immune system to restrain excessive pro-inflammatory control is the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs), a subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that limit tissue damage induced during virus infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>In mice, Tregs can be expanded by application of the preformed IL-2/antibody complex, IL-2/JES6-1 (IL-2 Ab Cx). The injection of IL-2 Ab Cx results in a drastic increase in the number of circulating Tregs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Prophylactic treatment using IL-2 Ab Cx has been shown to be effective in alleviating various immunopathologies including herpetic stromal keratitis, malaria and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In our previous study using a CHIKV infection mouse model, prophylactic treatment with IL-2 Ab Cx also abrogated CHIKV-induced joint inflammation through selective expansion of Tregs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. While this intervention was highly effective, IL-2 Ab Cx was injected prophylactically prior to virus infection. In a more relevant setting, we therefore explored the potential of IL-2 Ab Cx as a therapeutic agent in this study. Interestingly, despite the increased number of circulating Tregs upon IL-2 Ab Cx administration after manifestation of inflamed joints, the treatment was counter-productive. Animals suffered from an aggravated inflamed joint pathology associated with an increased infiltration of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> effector T cells (Teffs). Profiling of Teffs in the draining lymph node indicated up-regulation of CD25, thus rendering them sensitive towards IL-2 Ab Cx. Administration of IL-2 Ab Cx at this point therefore led to a massive expansion of virus-specific Teffs, which then migrate to the infected joint footpad and aggravate inflamed joint pathology. We show that active virus infection can change the response pattern of IL-2 Ab Cx, resulting in the expansion of pro-inflammatory rather than anti-inflammatory T cells, cautioning its use as a therapeutic agent.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Administration of IL-2 Ab Cx after virus infection exacerbates inflamed joint pathology</title><p>It was previously shown that prophylactic IL-2 Ab Cx treatment effectively mediates the expansion of Tregs, resulting in the alleviation of CHIKV-induced inflamed joints<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.

The incubation period for CHIKV typically ranges from 3&#x02013;14 days in patients and it is during this period where patients normally seek treatment to alleviate the symptoms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Therefore, therapeutic administration of IL-2 Ab Cx was chosen on 3&#x02013;5dpi to represent the clinical setting.</p><p>Although the administration of IL-2 Ab Cx increased the levels of circulating Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>), this did not translate to the protective response that was observed in the prophylactic setting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Instead, an exacerbation of the inflamed joint was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). While the administration of IL-2 Ab Cx did not affect the course of viremia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>), the exacerbation in pathology took place between 7 to 10 dpi when the control groups (PBS, IL-2 only, JES6-1 only) were already starting to recover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b,d</xref>). This observation is in sharp contrast to the striking reduction of virus-induced joint footpad swelling observed during prophylactic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Therapeutic treatment with IL-2 Ab Cx causes infiltration of CD25-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3-Teffs</title><p>Experiments in <italic>CD4</italic>-knockout (KO) mice indicated that CD4<sup>+</sup> Teffs are important drivers of CHIKV-induced pathology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.

Cells were profiled on 7 dpi when differences in the inflamed joint pathology between treated and non-treated mice were most striking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Although there was no significant difference in the number of infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the joint footpad of IL-2 Ab Cx-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>), a significant increase in the number of infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T effector cells (Teffs) expressing CD25 was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p>CD25 is the &#x003b1;-chain of the IL-2 receptor and confer high affinity of the receptor complex for IL-2.

Indeed, cytometry analysis of popliteal lymph nodes (pLNs) from virus-infected mice showed a significant increase in the expression of CD25 on Teffs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2a and b</xref>). Notably, expression of CD122 (IL-2R&#x003b2;) was also regulated on these Teffs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2c</xref>). Upregulation of these IL-2 receptor chains is likely to render the Teffs more sensitive to the presence of IL-2 Ab Cx.</p><p>The significant increase in CD25<sup>+</sup> Teffs in the footpad of CHIKV-infected mice suggests that exposure to IL-2 Ab Cx during virus infection promote their expansion and resulted in exacerbated joint inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, other subsets that were examined showed no significant difference between the control and IL-2 Ab Cx-treated groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>).

This strongly suggests that it is the infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> Teffs that were responsible for exacerbating pathology.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Therapeutic intervention with IL-2 Ab Cx activates Teffs in the draining lymph node</title><p>Draining pLN cells were isolated from virus-infected mice on 6 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). While the numbers of Tregs and Teffs in IL-2 Ab Cx-treated mice were not significantly different from the PBS-treated mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4a and e</xref>), Teffs were markedly activated after IL-2 Ab Cx treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4b&#x02013;d</xref>). Compared to PBS-treated virus-infected mice (PBS), upregulation of CD25 was observed in the entire Teffs population of IL-2 Ab Cx-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4d</xref>). Profiling of the Teffs further revealed a marked increase of the activation markers CD44 and CTLA-4 with IL-2 Ab Cx treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4b and c</xref>), while the Tregs in pLNs showed only a moderate increase in these activation markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4f and g</xref>). The latter was a surprising and intriguing observation as splenic Tregs showed very robust proliferation in response to the therapeutic IL-2 Ab Cx treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). Expansion of Tregs was accompanied by strong upregulation of activation markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5a&#x02013;c</xref>), similar to what was observed in the prophylactic intervention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Moreover, in contrast to pLN Teffs, splenic Teffs remained completely unresponsive to the IL-2 Ab Cx treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>). Thus, IL-2 Ab Cx has different effects on the T cell populations in the two compartments during an active virus infection.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>pLN Teffs from virus-infected animals are responsive to IL-2</title><p>In contrast to Teffs, Tregs constitutively express CD25 (IL-2R&#x003b1;) on their surface<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.

The signal induced through interactions of IL-2 and IL-2R is mediated through Jak-STAT5 pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Phosphorylation of STAT5 (pSTAT5) is one of the earliest events in IL-2R signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and can be measured <italic>in vitr</italic>o by flow cytometry. In healthy non-infected (N.I) mice, only splenic Tregs show phosphorylation of STAT5 at low IL-2 concentrations. In Teffs, pSTAT5 is detectable at very high IL-2 concentration in only a small fraction of the population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref>). The fraction of pSTAT5<sup>+</sup> cells was substantially higher Tregs compared to Teffs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref>). However, no significant difference in pSTAT5 signaling was observed in the Tregs between N.I and virus-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref>). On the other hand, a higher level of pSTAT5 signaling was observed in Teffs from virus-infected mice as compared to the N.I mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c,d</xref>). On further analysis, it is revealed that majority of the Teffs from CHIKV-infected mice that responded to IL-2 are CD25<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e,f</xref>). Thus Teffs from virus-infected mice are more sensitive to IL-2 signaling, and hence are also more likely to respond to the IL-2 Ab Cx treatment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>A large fraction of human Teffs is sensitive to IL-2</title><p>In na&#x000ef;ve mice, typically all of the IL-2 responsive cells are Tregs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4a</xref>). To determine if the same applies in humans, a series of IL-2 stimulations was done on human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy donors. While human Tregs are extremely sensitive to IL-2, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>), a large fraction of the Teffs was also able to respond well to IL-2. Further characterization revealed that the majority of Teffs that responded are of the memory (CD45RA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). In contrast, the proportion of na&#x000ef;ve (CD45RA<sup>+</sup>) Teffs that responded to even high levels of IL-2 are negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). This observation could explain the low response in the N.I. mice to IL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>).</p><p>A major difference between humans and laboratory mice is the lifespan as well as the level of exposures to environmental antigens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.

However, the conversion of the anti-inflammatory into a pro-inflammatory effect during therapeutic applications has yet to be reported. In the malaria model, administration of the antibody complex right after acute malaria infection at 0 to 2 days resulted in increased Treg numbers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. However, in the EAE model, administration of the antibody complex 7 days after MOG induction (3 days after disease onset) resulted in the loss of protection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. In our study, the complex was administered just before the peak of disease, when the clinical symptoms have already manifested in the form of joint inflammation. The CD4<sup>+</sup> Teffs in the draining pLNs have already expressed high levels of CD25 and this rendered them receptive to the IL-2 Ab Cx, which resulted in expansion and activation of pathogen-specific Teffs. Notably, the direction of outcome of the IL-2 Ab Cx treatment strongly depends in the compartment. Although a similar selective expansion of Tregs was observed in the spleen and blood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, an accumulation of highly activated Teffs was observed in the draining pLNs.</p><p>The heightened sensitivity of these cells to IL-2 was associated with upregulation of CD25, the IL-2R&#x003b1; chain that confers high affinity to IL-2R<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>.

Life expectancy of humans average around 70 yrs, allowing large accumulation of memory cells due to multiple exposures to environmental stimulus and pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. These CD25-expressing memory cells are poised to respond immediately to strong T cell stimulus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>.
