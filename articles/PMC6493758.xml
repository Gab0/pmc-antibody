Csf1r inhibition in mice reduced F4/80<sup>hi</sup> KCs by approximately 50%, but did not affect CD11b<sup>hi</sup> KCs. Clodronate liposomes depleted F4/80<sup>hi</sup> KCs, but also altered levels of other intrahepatic leukocytes. Csf1r inhibition delayed LR, as demonstrated by a 20% reduction in liver-to-body weight ratios 7 days after PH. At 36h after PH, Csf1r inhibition increased serum ALT and histological liver injury, and decreased liver cell proliferation. A small molecule inhibitor of Mer did not alter the percentage of KCs or their proliferation and just modestly delayed LR. In vitro, Csf1r or Mer inhibition did not decrease KC viability, but did attenuate their cytokine response to stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>F4/80<sup>hi</sup> KCs are Mer<sup>+</sup> and can be subdivided based on Csf1r expression.

KCs are important homeostatic regulators of the liver&#x02019;s immune tolerogenic immune environment and mediators of liver injury and repair.[<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Several phenotypic and functional KC subsets have been identified.[<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] CD11b<sup>hi</sup> KCs are small, radiosensitive, cytokine-producing cells that are dispersed throughout the liver parenchyma.

Meanwhile, CD68 stains both CD11b<sup>hi</sup> and F4/80<sup>hi</sup> KCs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216275.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>), and is also present at low levels on some dendritic cells. It is known that CD68 is also detectable in lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells.[<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Furthermore, intracellular staining for CD68 requires cell fixation, thereby preventing subsequent functional analysis in vitro. Here, we sought to investigate other markers of KCs and showed that nearly all F4/80<sup>hi</sup> KCs were Mer<sup>+</sup>. Notably, eosinophils expressed intermediate amounts of F4/80 and therefore may contaminate F4/80<sup>+</sup> NPCs if the eosinophil marker Siglec-F is not used. Mer was not expressed by other liver NPCs, so it appears to be a more specific marker of KCs than F4/80 and CD68. Taken together, we define liver tissue-resident macrophages as CD45<sup>+</sup>Mer<sup>+</sup>.</p><p>F4/80<sup>hi</sup> KCs are known to depend on the growth factor receptor Csf1r. Unexpectedly, though, only half of Mer<sup>+</sup> KCs expressed Csf1r. To study Csf1r expression by KCs, we used a Csf1r-GFP transgenic mouse[<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] because our collagenase-based liver NPC isolation protocol degraded Csf1r, making it undetectable by conventional flow cytometry. Mer<sup>+</sup>Csf1r<sup>+</sup> and Mer<sup>+</sup>Csf1r<sup>-</sup> KCs had distinct expression of a panel of macrophage markers and divided at different rates based on intracellular Ki-67 staining. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether these two subsets represent different developmental or maturational stages of KCs.</p><p>To study the function of individual KC subsets in vivo, it would be ideal to deplete them without significantly altering other liver NPCs. While clodronate liposomes have been used widely to deplete F4/80<sup>hi</sup> KCs, it is well recognized that both clodronate and PBS liposomes have confounding effects on NPCs,[<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] as we further documented here. In contrast, we found that Csf1r inhibition specifically targeted the Csf1r<sup>+</sup> subset of F4/80<sup>hi</sup>Mer<sup>+</sup> KCs, but had only minor effects on other liver NPCs. Notably, compensatory mechanisms appeared to develop after four weeks of Csf1r inhibition by PLX5622 treatment, since the percentage of F4/80<sup>hi</sup> cells in the liver increased (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0216275.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>) and Csf1r<sup>+</sup> cells were especially apparent by immunohistochemistry (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0216275.s003">S3F Fig</xref></bold>). Furthermore, while one week of PLX5622 treatment reduced blood Ly6c<sup>hi</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes by 25%, there was a monocyte surge above baseline at 2 weeks, and the percentage of blood monocytes normalized by 4 weeks of treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0216275.s003">S3G Fig</xref></bold>). Finally, after 1 week of Csf1r inhibition, expression of the growth factor receptor Flt-3 in liver and spleen Ly6c<sup>hi</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes increased (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0216275.s003">S3H Fig</xref></bold>). In contrast to Csf1r inhibition, Mer inhibition, at least with the compound we tested, did not affect the percentage or proliferation of Mer<sup>+</sup> KCs. In fact, Mer<sup>-/-</sup> mice had a normal percentage of F4/80<sup>+</sup> KCs and normal LR. Since there may be compensatory mechanisms in this knockout mouse, we did not perform further experiments in them. However, given that the Mer inhibitor delayed regeneration raises the possibility of an off target effect of the inhibitor. Thus, Csf1r appears to be more important than Mer in the viability of KCs. Nevertheless, Mer inhibition did increase the expression of Kit in Mer<sup>+</sup> KCs, indicating that Mer contributes to KC homeostasis and Kit may compensate for its function.</p><p>Recently, a group constructed a mouse designed to allow depletion of F4/80<sup>hi</sup> KCs; the mouse has a diphtheria-toxin receptor gene (DTR) driven by the C-type lectin Clec4f promoter, which is active specifically in liver macrophages.[<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] F4/80<sup>hi</sup> KCs were depleted after a single dose of diphtheria toxin, although the effect on other liver NPCs was not detailed. In our lab, we investigated KC depletion in two other DTR models. Liver CD11b<sup>hi</sup> KCs were not depleted in CD11b-DTR mice[<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] despite different diphtheria toxin doses and schedules, even though other CD11b<sup>hi</sup> macrophages were depleted, including CD11b<sup>hi</sup> peritoneal macrophages. In contrast, diphtheria toxin depleted both KC subsets in CCR2-DTR mice[<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], as well as conventional and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Another limitation of using CD11b-DTR or CCR2-DTR mice, or even Csf1r inhibition, is that macrophages outside of the liver are also affected.</p><p>Activation of the innate immune system is a hallmark of LR. The role of F4/80<sup>hi</sup> KCs in LR has been well documented through the use of clodronate liposomes.[<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Another group described impaired LR in the osteopetrotic mouse (M-CSF knockout),[<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] underscoring the importance of mature body macrophages during LR. The role of Csf1r signaling in developmentally normal mice during LR has not been documented previously. We found that disruption of Mer<sup>+</sup>Csf1r<sup>+</sup> KCs via Csf1r inhibition is sufficient to increase liver injury and impair LR, as shown by lower liver-to-body weight ratios. To study whether Csf1r stimulation could enhance LR in wild-type mice, we administered M-CSF before and after PH. Despite expansion of Mer<sup>+</sup> KCs in vivo by as much as 20%, liver-to-body weight ratios were equivalent at 4 and 7 days after PH (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0216275.s003">S3I Fig</xref></bold>). Csf1r also appeared to be important to baseline liver homeostasis in the absence of PH, since Csf1r inhibition alone increased liver-to-body weight ratios after 1, 2, and 4 weeks of treatment (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0216275.s003">S3A Fig</xref></bold>).</p><p>Csf1r inhibition reduced IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; production in vitro by Mer<sup>+</sup>Csf1r<sup>+</sup> KCs, but not Mer<sup>+</sup>Csf1r<sup>-</sup> KCs. Meanwhile, disruption of Mer signaling with a potent and selective Mer inhibitor also delayed LR, even though the percentage and proliferation of Mer<sup>+</sup> KCs remained unchanged. However, Mer inhibition also reduced the production of IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; by Mer<sup>+</sup>Csf1r<sup>+</sup> KCs in vitro. These data are consistent with the importance of local cytokine production by Mer<sup>+</sup> KCs during hepatocyte priming in the initial phases of LR. Local production of IL-6 is known to be critical for the priming phase of LR.[<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] While STAT3 activation is essential, [<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0216275.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] excessive IL-6 can actually be detrimental.[<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Other groups showed a failure to mount an adequate circulating cytokine response after LR in animals treated with clodronate liposomes.[<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0216275.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In contrast, we showed that despite higher levels of circulating IL-6 during the priming phase, Csf1r inhibition still delayed LR, consistent with the importance of local production of IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; within the regenerating liver.</p><p>Thus, tissue-resident macrophages of the liver are more specifically defined by Mer expression than by F4/80 expression. Two subsets of Mer<sup>+</sup> KCs are defined by Csf1r expression. Csf1r inhibition selectively decreased the percentage, proliferation, and functioning of Mer<sup>+</sup>Csf1r<sup>+</sup> KCs, and was sufficient to alter baseline liver homeostasis and delay LR. Mer inhibition also affected LR, without affecting the percentage or proliferation of Mer<sup>+</sup> KCs. Csf1r or Mer inhibition specifically reduced cytokine expression of Mer<sup>+</sup>Csf1r<sup>+</sup> KCs in vitro. Csf1r and Mer signaling pathways are appealing for further study in LR and other models of liver injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0216275.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>(A)</bold> Flow cytometry gating strategy of B6 liver NPCs.
