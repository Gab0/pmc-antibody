There was a robust antibody response to GAA in wild-type mice injected with this vector. In contrast, the anti-GAA IgG1 response was diminished in MyD88KO mice, and showed a trend toward a decrease in TRIFKO mice. In addition, the vector genome and GAA activity were significantly higher in MyD88KO livers compared with wild-type livers, suggesting reduced cytotoxic T cell responses. Importantly, elevated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were detected by immunohistochemistry in MyD88KO livers. When adoptively transferred to wild-type mice, these CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have an ability to suppress antibody responses against AAV2/8-CBhGAA and to prevent further immunization against rhGAA. Our study suggests that the MyD88 deficiency leads to the suppression of deleterious immune responses to AAV2/8-CBhGAA, which has implications for gene therapy in Pompe disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Key words</title><kwd>AAV vectors</kwd><kwd>acid-alpha glucosidase</kwd><kwd>gene transfer</kwd><kwd>glycogen storage disease</kwd><kwd>immunology</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><ref-count count="25"/><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s001"><title>Introduction</title><p>G<sc>ene therapy has great potential</sc> for the potentially curative treatment of genetic diseases involving muscle, including metabolic myopathies such as Pompe disease and the muscular dystrophies.

We found that both MyD88 and TRIF signaling pathway were important for antibody responses to AAV-CBhGAA. More importantly, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (possibly CD4<sup>+</sup>,CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells) were responsible for decreased anti-GAA IgG1 responses in MyD88KO mice receiving AAV-CBhGAA. The effect of TRIF deficiency was less than that of MyD88 deficiency, consistent with its adaptor role in the MyD88/TRIF response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref></sup> The current data for AAV-CBhGAA are similar to the reported patterns of acute immune responses to AAV2, although we found changes in expression of fewer genes and peaks at different times. In the past, it is generally held that innate immune responses to AAV vectors are weak and transient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref></sup> However, Zaiss, et al. reported that a AAV2 vector induced high expression of several inflammatory genes in liver 1h following the vector injection, similarly to an adenovirus vector, and that this increase disappeared by 24&#x02009;h. A recent study showed a mild three-to fourfold increase in hepatic expression of TLR9, MyD88, TNF-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, IP-10, and CCL2 after 2&#x02009;h injection of a ssAAV-F.IX via portal circulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref></sup> All responses were transient and declined after 6&#x02009;h. AAV8 was considered less immunogeneic than AAV2. Indeed, there was no change in many genes we tested; only the expression of CXCL-1 and IL-1&#x003b2; induced by CB-hGAA was detected. The TLR9-MyD88 signaling pathway was shown to be involved in activation of pDC to produce IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;. The cellular source of increased CXCL-1 induced by CB-hGAA could be Kupffer cells in the liver or monocytes in circulation, while increases in IL-1&#x003b2; suggest activation of the inflammasome. The precise mechanism of immune activation in the liver by AAV-CBhGAA, and not AAV-LSPhGAA, remains to be further investigated.</p><p>A model for immune tolerance following gene therapy in Pompe disease recognizes the central role of regulatory T (Treg) cells in the setting of liver-specific transgene expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref></sup> Several factors determine the ability to avoid immune responses against the transgene through liver-specific expression. Liver-specific expression of human FIX in mice with hemophilia B prevented antibody formation in response to an immune challenge with human FIX.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref></sup> Furthermore, the adoptive transfer of CD4<sup>+</sup>,CD25<sup>+</sup> cells (including Treg cells) to na&#x000ef;ve recipient mice, following administration of the AAV vector-expressing human FIX to donor mice, prevented antibody formation in response to an immune challenge with FIX.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref></sup> An AAV vector containing a liver-specific regulatory cassette to drive &#x003b1;-galactosidase expression-induced immune tolerance to &#x003b1;-galactosidase in Fabry disease mice, and the transfer of splenocytes from vector-treated mice prevented the antibody response against an &#x003b1;-galactosidase challenge in recipient Fabry mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref></sup> Finally, anti-CD25 administration prevented the induction of immune tolerance with our LSP-containing vector in GAAKO mice, presumably be depleting Treg cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup> Taken together, these data strongly support the ability of an AAV vector containing a liver-specific regulatory cassette to induce immune tolerance to an introduced foreign protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup></p><p>The importance of antibody formation in response to therapy in lysosomal storage disorders, such as Pompe disease, has become increasingly evident. The formation of high titer, sustained antibodies has correlated strongly with clinical decline and abbreviated survival, despite compliance with standard of care ERT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref></sup> Furthermore, the clinical relevance of antibody responses to ERT in other lysosomal storage disorders has been increasingly apparent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref></sup> Thus, further characterization of the antibody responses to ERT and development of therapeutic strategies to address these responses is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s012" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>DDK was supported by NIH grants R01HL081122 from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and R01HD054795 from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
