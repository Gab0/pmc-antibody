As such, numerous studies have demonstrated their effective uptake and proteolytic activities coupled with antigen processing and presentation functions. Yet, less is known about how these cellular mechanisms change and develop as myeloid cells progress from progenitor cells to more differentiated cell types such as DC. Thus, our study comparatively examined these functions at different stages of myeloid cell development driven by the GM-CSF. To measure these activities at different stages of development, GM-CSF driven bone marrow cells were sorted based on expression of Ly6C, CD115, and CD11c. This strategy enables isolation of cells representing five distinct myeloid cell types: Common Myeloid Progenitor (CMP), Granulocyte/Macrophage Progenitor (GMP), monocytes, monocyte-derived Macrophage/monocyte-derived Dendritic cell Precursors (moMac/moDP), and monocyte-derived DC (moDC). We observed significant differences in the uptake capacity, proteolysis, and antigen processing and presentation functions between these myeloid cell populations. CMP showed minimal uptake capacity with no detectable antigen processing and presenting function. The GMP population showed higher uptake capacity, modest proteolytic activity, and little T cell stimulatory function. In the monocyte population, the uptake capacity reached its peak, yet this cell type had minimal antigen processing and presentation function. Finally, moMac/moDP and moDC had a modestly decreased uptake capacity, high degradative capacity and strong antigen processing and presentation functions. These insights into when antigen processing and presentation function develop in myeloid cells during GM-CSF driven differentiation are crucial to the development of vaccines, allowing targeting of the most qualified cells as an ideal vaccine vehicles.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15 AI107773</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6220-3282</contrib-id><name><surname>Hiltbold Schwartz</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported National Institutes of Health, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Grant R15 AI107773.

DC represent remarkable group of cells found in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues under inflamed and/or steady state conditions. These cells have been classified into different subsets based on phenotypic and functional profiles [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196591.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Phenotypically, expression of the integrin CD11c and high levels of MHC class II have been used to broadly identify DC. Subsets of DC are further separated based on expression of CD8, CD4, CD11b, and CD45R [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The functional attributes used in sub-setting DC include migration potential, antigen uptake capability, processing and presentation to the T cells [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196591.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196591.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Steady state DC, whose differentiation is dependent on Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-ligand (Flt3L), represent conventional lymphoid resident or migratory DC [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The steady state DC that include both conventional DC (cDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) differentiate from common DC precursor (CDP) and through an intermediate stage known as pre-DCs [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196591.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Under inflammatory conditions however, monocyte-derived DC (moDC) development and differentiation is driven by Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Historically, it has been difficult to acquire sufficient numbers of DC directly <italic>ex vivo</italic> for functional analysis. DC are typically present in much lower numbers than lymphocytes in lymphoid organs and are of relatively low abundance in peripheral tissues as well [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, for decades, GM-CSF has been a favorite cytokine used to generate large numbers of DC from mouse bone marrow <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Much of what we understand about the endocytic capacity, proteolytic activity, phagosomal maturation, and antigen processing and presenting function of GM-CSF-driven cells has come from studies on differentiated cells, DC and macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, we know comparatively little about the developmental stage at which these functions develop. It is therefore important to investigate the development of these functions in order to identify the most qualified cells for therapeutic uses.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the previously unrecognized heterogeneity of bone marrow cultured in GM-CSF [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196591.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. While the GM-CSF-driven culture method is known to generate a large population of CD11c<sup>+</sup>MHCII<sup>+</sup> moDC, the relatively high frequency of monocyte-derived macrophages (moMac) in these cultures had not been appreciated [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These two cell types were distinguished based on the expression level of CD11c and MHC class II (moMac are MHCII<sup>lo/int</sup>, moDC are MHCII<sup>hi</sup>) [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our recent study confirmed and extended these findings and identified an intermediate precursor cell, the monocyte-derived DC precursor (moDP), which shares many phenotypic characteristics with moMacs, but are distinguished by higher MHCII expression and ability to give rise to moDC [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus, this cell type is termed moDP.</p><p>To elucidate the functional capacity of each distinct myeloid cell population during GM-CSF driven differentiation, we have developed a sorting strategy that enables the isolation of five distinct myeloid cell populations based on the expression of Ly6C, CD115, and CD11c. The phenotypic profile of these developmental stages is as follows: common myeloid progenitor (CMP): Ly6C<sup>-</sup>CD115<sup>-</sup>CD11C<sup>-</sup>, granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP): Ly6C<sup>+</sup>CD115<sup>-</sup>CD11C<sup>-</sup>, Monocytes: Ly6C<sup>+</sup>CD115<sup>+</sup>CD11C<sup>-</sup>, monocyte-derived macrophages/monocyte-derived DC precursors (moMac/moDP): Ly6C<sup>-</sup>CD115<sup>+</sup>CD11C<sup>+</sup>, and monocyte-derived DC (moDC): Ly6C<sup>-</sup>CD115<sup>-</sup>CD11C<sup>+</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus, by isolating each of these populations, we set out to clearly define how the cellular uptake mechanisms, phagosomal acidification, and proteolytic activity change during myeloid cell development, and how these functional mechanisms impact the antigen processing and presentation function of these distinct myeloid cell populations along the developmental pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6, OT-1 (C57BL/6-Tg(TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/J) and OT-II (B6.Cg-Tg(TcraTcrb)425Cbn/J) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory.

In brief, bone marrow was harvested from mice and the red blood cells were lysed. The cells were cultured in RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), glutamine (2 mM) and 10 ng/mL granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).

These receptors play important roles in cell adhesion as well as optimizing uptake of different types of particles or antigens. However, the relative expression of these receptors at distinct stages of GM-CSF-driven cell development is not well defined. Thus, we measured the expression of these receptors during GM-CSF driven differentiation of murine bone marrow from days 3 through 7. The heterogeneous populations of bone marrow were stained with antibodies to scavenger receptor (CD36), mannose receptor (MMR, CD206) and Dectin-1 and expression was measured by flow cytometry.

However, MHCII<sup>hi</sup> populations still demonstrated the highest phagosomal pH, with an average pH 5.68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196591.g006">Fig 6E</xref>), a pH closer to that observed in moDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196591.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we assessed the proteolytic activity of these cells by utilizing DQ-OVA.

Taken together, these results indicate that the moMac population had the highest phagocytic activity, moderate pH and mild proteolysis while the moDP population was slightly less phagocytic and had the lowest phagosomal pH and highest degradative activity. Finally, the moDC population had greatly reduced phagocytosis, more neutral pH and moderate degradative activity.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Functional capacity of early progenitors isolated directly ex vivo</title><p>Finally, to ensure that our functional analyses were reflective of those observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, we examined the functional capacity of early progenitor cell types CMP, GMP, and monocytes freshly isolated from bone marrow.

As a result, less is known about when these cellular mechanisms develop or how they change as myeloid cells progress from progenitor cells to more differentiated cell types. In this study, we have now determined that as the cells develop, they undergo significant changes in phenotypic and functional characteristics including: expression of uptake receptors, endocytic capacity, phagosomal pH, proteolytic activity, and antigen processing and presenting capacity.</p><p>CMPs, the earliest cell type examined demonstrated little endocytic or phagocytic activity, low proteolytic potential, and the highest phagosomal pH of all of the populations, at near neutral. CMPs are progenitor cells that have the ability to give rise to all the myeloid cells [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. As such, CMPs have not yet developed all the necessary cellular machinery that could either enhance their antigen uptake capacity or degradative potential. In addition, CMPs had little ability to induce T cell proliferation or activation. CMPs showed the lowest response in all of the functional analyses in this study. However, this does not indicate that these cells are functionally incompetent. As such, a recent study illustrated the immune suppressive activity of CMP and GMP in the context of tumors as evidence in the ability of these cells to inhibit T cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Taken together, our study shows that CMPs are not potent at inducing T cell activation, but does not rule out a role for these cells in immune regulation.</p><p>GMP, the second stage along the GM-CSF-driven developmental spectrum, demonstrated high phagocytic capacity, moderate proteolysis and slightly more acidic phagosomal pH. Also, GMP demonstrated only slight antigen presentation function, evidenced in their ability to present OVA peptide to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196591.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). This observation might be attributed to the fact that innate immune cells constitutively express MHC class I molecules, potentially accounting for the ability of GMP to induce CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation. However, GMPs were only able to induce CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation without activation, as evidenced in low expression of CD25. In addition, GMP had lower expression of MHC class II, which could explain the inability of these cells to induce CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation.</p><p>Monocytes had the highest phagocytic capability, and high expression of the uptake receptors when compared with CMP and GMP. The high uptake potential observed in monocytes was expected because these cells are known to be highly phagocytic, and they are endowed with a large repertoire of uptake receptors [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In addition, monocytes demonstrated high proteolytic capacity and low phagosomal pH, two functional properties that also support the antimicrobial activities of this cell type [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. There have been conflicting results about the role of monocytes in antigen processing and presentation. For instance, a recent study demonstrated that Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes can cross-present cell-associated antigen to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in a manner similar to DC [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], while another showed that monocytes are poor at presenting antigen [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this study, we observed that within this population, antigen processing and presentation functions started to develop as evidenced in their ability to induce minimal CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation when given OVA protein. Notably, monocytes were poor at presenting OVA peptide to na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells when compared with moMac/moDP and moDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196591.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Perhaps the peptide was less stable in this population. However, we observed that monocytes could cross present OVA protein to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and induce T cell proliferation.</p><p>moMac/moDP includes cell types that phenotypically resemble macrophages as well as precursor cells, moDP, that can further differentiate to moDC [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus, some of the functional characteristics of the moMac/moDP cell population closely resemble moDC. First, we observed that moMac/moDP had high expression of uptake receptors and moderate uptake of BioParticles and dextran when compared with monocytes. In addition, the kinetics of proteolytic activities showed that moMac/moDP had high degradative capacity and the lowest phagosomal pH when compared with other cell types. Macrophages are known to have antimicrobial properties and are highly degradative, in line with their function in clearance of invading microbes [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>While this is the first study examining the function of moDP, the functional characteristics of moMac have been more extensively studied. The moMac can acquire different functional attributes depending on the environmental cues, activation status, and inflammatory signals [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In addition, moMac can change their phenotype from a proinflammatory mediator to anti-inflammatory mediator and vice-versa, demonstrating their functional plasticity [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196591.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. To further determine the functional differences between the moMac and moDP, the mixed cell population was separated into three distinct populations based on the expression of MHCII. When we compared uptake capacity in MHCII<sup>low</sup> and MHCII<sup>int</sup> populations, corresponding to moMac and moDP respectively, we observed that the moMac cell population demonstrated higher uptake capacity than moDP, and moDC (MHCII<sup>hi</sup> population) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196591.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Although different moMac populations have been shown to differ to some extent in phagocytic capacity [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196591.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] owing to the distinct array of uptake receptors they express [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], moMac generally have a higher uptake capacity when compared with DC [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This observation was consistent with our results.</p><p>Moreover, the phagosomal pH of different macrophage subtypes may also be distinct. For example, pro-inflammatory macrophages maintaining a pH close to neutral while the anti-inflammatory macrophages rapidly acidify their phagosomes [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. When we examined the phagosome acidification in moMac and moDP, we observed that both cell populations had lower phagosomal pH when compared with moDC (MHCII<sup>hi</sup> population) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196591.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The highly efficient phagosomal acidification observed in moMac/moDP could make this cell better suited at controlling microbes, a function that will need to be further examined. Finally, moDP had a slightly higher proteolytic activity when compared with moMac.</p><p>Intriguingly, we found that antigen processing and presenting functions develop before GM-CSF driven myeloid cells became fully differentiated moDC. moMac/moDP had a strong ability to induce CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation and activation at a rate that is comparable with moDC. The ability of moMac/moDP to stimulate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation was greater than that observed in GM-Macs, a cell type highlighted by Helft et.al (similar to moMac in our study) [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our data demonstrated that moMac/moDP is a unique mixture of cell types including those with similarity to GM-Macs, but also potent at priming na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in a manner similar to moDC. This potent T cell activation capacity is likely mediated by the moDP population present in this complex population.</p><p>moDC functions are well characterized in the literature. It is well established that as DCs mature, they down-regulate their uptake mechanisms in favor of presenting the processed antigen via MHC on the cell surface [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196591.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The observed decrease in uptake of BioParticles by moDC when compared with moDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196591.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) could be a result of moDC being more differentiated and having less phagocytic activity. However, the uptake of dextran in both moMac/moDP and moDC reflects their ability to continuously take in bulk extracellular fluid, likely by macropinocytosis. In addition, moDC demonstrated a similar proteolytic activity and slightly higher phagosomal pH than moMac/moDP. These observed differences between moMac/moDP and moDC might be because moDC are more differentiated. In fact, several studies have indicated that DC have low degradative potential and high phagosomal pH, allowing for preservation of antigen for immune recognition [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196591.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0196591.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Interestingly, phagosomal pH is known to decrease at least initially upon DC maturation, attributed to full assembly of vATPase on the mature DC phagosomal membranes [<xref rid="pone.0196591.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Future studies in this arena should thus include an examination of vATPase assembly and activity in developing cells. Among all cell types examined in this study, we found that moDC were most potent at inducing both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation and activation, reaffirming their status as professional antigen presenting cells.</p><p>In summary, we have been able to systematically show the function of distinct myeloid cell populations during GM-CSF driven differentiation and how these functions change as the cells progress through their development. Importantly, we have been able to demonstrate in this study that antigen processing and presenting capability is a function that is acquired prior to the cells becoming moDC. This insight is essential because it could enhance the utilization of most qualified cells to function as antigen presenting cells in the design of vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0196591.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>The expression of MHC class I and MHC class II molecules during GM-CSF driven differentiation.</title><p>Sorted cells were stained with antibodies to Ly6C, CD115, and CD11c.
