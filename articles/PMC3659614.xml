In this study, we examined the effects of G-Rp1 on regulatory T cell (Treg) activation. After treatment of splenocytes with G-Rp1, Tregs exhibited upregulation of IL-10 expression, and along with dendritic cells (DCs), these Tregs showed increased cell number compared to other cell populations. The effect of G-Rp1 on Treg number was augmented in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which mimics pathological changes that occur during inflammation. However, depletion of DCs prevented the increase in Treg number in the presence of G-Rp1 and/or LPS. In addition, G-Rp1 promoted the differentiation of the memory types of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>low</sup> Tregs rather than the generation of new Tregs. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments also demonstrated that Tregs and DCs from mice that were fed G-Rp1 for 7 d and then injected with LPS exhibited increased activation compared with those from mice that were injected with LPS alone. Expression of TGF-&#x003b2; and CTLA4 in Tregs was increased, and upregulation of IL-2 and CD80/ CD86 expression by DCs affected the suppressive function of Tregs through IL-2 receptors and CTLA4.

In particular, red ginseng, which is steamed and sun-dried <italic>P. ginseng</italic>, has widely been utilized to boost the immune system. Many previous studies have indicated that red ginseng contains saponin components, such as ginsenoside Rh1 (G-Rh1), G-Rh2, G-Rg3, and G-Rg5, which all have anti-tumor activity in prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B001">[1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B005">5]</xref>. Because these components are not stable, G-Rp1, which is a chemically stable component with ten-fold more potent anti-tumor activity than G-Rg3, has been derived from crude ginsenosides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B006">[6]</xref>. Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B007">[7]</xref> documented the safety and effects of G-Rp1 on anti-tumor activity and demonstrated that G-Rp1-treated mice had a significant reduction in pathological symptoms in papillomagenesis. In addition, Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B008">[8]</xref> reported that mice with orally-administered G-Rp1 displayed diminished pulmonary metastatic colony numbers in a mouse model of lung metastasis. Furthermore, G-Rp1 has been reported to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production though inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#x003ba;B) pathway in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B009">[9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B010">10]</xref>. Although several reports have shown that G-Rp1 possesses anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory activities, its function in cellular levels has not yet been studied.</p><p>Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppress the immune responses of other cells by producing the immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;. The importance of Treg function has been shown in Foxp3- deficient and IL-10-deficient mice, which developed severe autoimmune diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B011">[11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B014">14]</xref>. In addition, Tregs are important for the suppression of inflammation at environmental interfaces, such as the lung and colon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B015">[15]</xref>. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that present antigenic peptides on major histocompatibility class II molecules to helper T cells, leading to the adaptive immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B016">[16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B017">17]</xref>. Recent studies showed that DCs activate Tregs directly and control Treg homeostasis <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B018">[18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B019">19]</xref>. In particular, a reduction in the numbers of DCs led to a loss of Tregs, and the remaining Tregs downregulated Foxp3 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B018">[18]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the effects of G-Rp1 on lymphocyte activation and cell numbers and Treg function in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation. We found that G-Rp1 increases Treg numbers in concert with an increase in DC activation. Increased numbers of Tregs resulted from the conversion of memory type Tregs rather than the generation of new Tregs. In addition, in mice fed G-Rp1, we observed anti-inflammatory effects through DC and Treg activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Preparation of cells</title><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the approval of Soongsil University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Tregs were slightly increased in the presence of G-Rp1. This effect was enhanced when the cells were stimulated with LPS, which mimics pathological changes that occur during inflammation. LPS binds to Toll-like receptor 4 on DCs and upregulates co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80 and CD86, on DCs. CD80 and CD86 bind to either CD28 or CTLA4 with higher affinity than CD28 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B024">[24]</xref>. In the absence of G-Rp1, LPS stimulates DCs and induces strong inflammatory responses. However, in the presence of G-Rp1, LPS stimulation increased DC and Treg numbers to a greater extent, suggesting that the increase in DCs may affect Treg numbers and function in LPS-induced inflammation. This notion was confirmed as depletion of DC prevented the increase in Treg numbers. Although IL-10 expression by Tregs was not diminished in the absence of DCs, the total amount of IL-10 was decreased as Treg numbers were not increased in this situation. The increase in Tregs by activated DCs stemmed from the conversion of CD62L<sup>low</sup> memory Tregs rather than from the generation of new Tregs.</p><p>Mice that were fed G-Rp1 exhibited greater activation of DCs and Tregs. In these mice, DCs upregulated CD80 and CD86 expression, and Tregs expressed higher levels of CTLA4 and TGF-&#x003b2; than cells from mice that were not fed G-Rp1. This result indicates that increased expression of CTLA4 and TGF-&#x003b2; by Tregs suppresses LPS-induced inflammatory responses. In agreement with this conclusion, mice that were fed G-Rp1 followed by LPS injection showed decreased immune cell numbers, especially Th and Tc cell numbers.</p><p>Because the inflammatory responses can lead to a variety of diseases, such as septic shock, autoimmunity, and cancers, control of inflammation is paramount. Here, we report that the immune suppression function by Tregs is augmented by oral administration of G-Rp1 and that this function occurs via DC activation. We therefore suggest that orally administrated G-Rp1 may help to prevent inflammatory diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the
