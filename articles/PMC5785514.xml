The etiology of vitiligo remains unclear. However, the critical role of melanocyte-reactive T cells is well recognized. Histological and genetic studies have demonstrated that vitiligo skin is populated with inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrates consisting of both activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Multiple factors, including genetic factors and environmental stimulation, activate the T cell-specific killing of epidermal melanocytes (MC) that ultimately leads to their death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Different Treg activation strategies, such as CCL22 up-regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and simvastatin administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, have demonstrated significant treatment effects in reversing depigmentation in h3TA2 and Pmel-1 vitiligo mice. However, despite the current availability of drug treatments, physical therapy, surgical treatments and other methods, clinical efficacy is not satisfactory. New therapeutic strategies should be evaluated and tested for patients with vitiligo.</p><p id="Par3">Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) is a member of the extended CTLA-4 family and is a receptor that, functioning as an immune checkpoint, down-regulates immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In response to binding by its ligands, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1(PD-L1) (B7-H1 or CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC or CD273)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, PD-1 represses the activation and function of T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. PD-1 is not usually expressed on resting T cells, but its expression is induced after T cell activation, for example, by ligation of the T cell receptor (TCR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The absence of PD-1 rendered mice resistant to viral infection and suppressed tumor growth and tumor metastasis by reducing the antigen-recognition threshold and increasing the cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. PD-1/PD-L1 pathway-targeted therapies are under development in multiple diseases, including different cancers. Keytruda (pembrolizumab or Lambrolizumab; MK-3475) is a humanized monoclonal IgG4 PD-1 antibody and has been approved by the FDA since September 4, 2014 for patients with advanced or unresected melanoma that no longer responds to other drugs.</p><p id="Par4">PD-L1, also known as B7-H1 and CD274, is a transmembrane glycoprotein and a member of the B7 family of immune regulatory molecules with an approximately 65&#x02009;kDa. Mature human PD-L1 consists of a 220 amino acid (aa) extracellular domain (ECD) with two immunoglobulin-like domains, a 21 aa transmembrane segment, and a 31 aa cytoplasmic domain, in which shares 73% and 74% aa sequence identity with mouse and rat PD-L1, respectively. B7-H1 is expressed on inflammatory-activated immune cells including macrophages, T cells, and B cells, keratinocytes, enothelial and intestinal epithelial cells, as well as a variety of carcinomas and melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The PD-L1-targeted therapy has also been demonstrated to be effective in experimental psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Overexpression of PD-1 protein was detected in the skin of the Imiquimod (IMQ)-induced murine model of psoriasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, in which inflammation was inhibited by injecting a recombinant PD-L1 protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Further experiments indicated that severe psoriatic inflammation was induced in PD-1-null mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the PD-L1 fusion protein is effective in inhibiting T cell activity in skin autoimmunity disease. Thus, we have a strong rationale to test whether the PD-L1 fusion protein could be a new therapeutic strategy in patients with vitiligo.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we tested the treatment effect of PD-L1 fusion protein in Pmel-1 vitiligo mice. We found that PD-L1 fusion protein treatment reversed depigmentation via a markedly increased abundance of Tregs in the skin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Depigmentation is markedly reversed after PD-L1 fusion protein injection</title><p id="Par6">First, we investigated the therapeutic effect of PD-L1-Fc <italic>in vivo</italic> using Pmel-1 mice, representing a slowly depigmenting model. PD-L1-Fc was administered intraperitoneally at 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/injection 3 times a week for 6 weeks. The recombinant mouse PD-L1/Fc used here is a disulfide-linked homodimeric protein after proteolytic removal of the signal peptide. To produce these recombinant protein, a DNA sequence encoding the extracellular domain (Met 1-Thr 238) of mouse PD-L1 (NP_068693.1) was fused with the C-terminal His-tagged Fc region of human IgG1 at the C-terminus. The PD-L1-Fc has strong affinity with its receptor, PD-1.

Depigmentation was observed and quantified once a week for all periods of treatment and for 10 weeks after the last PD-L1 fusion protein injection. Compared with control IgG treatment, PD-L1-Fc treatment significantly reversed depigmentation after the last injection, as represented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>. Depigmentation was quantified in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, and treatment restored 57.8% of the original pigment loss when compared with that of vehicle-treated control animals after the last treatment [22.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;14.6% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) and 51.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;23.7% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) depigmentation of regrowing hair, respectively (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.014)]. The significant treatment effects were found until 8 weeks after the last injection. However, the differences between the PD-L1-treated and control groups were no longer significant 9 weeks after the last injection. Fortunately, no significant side effects were observed, including skin carcinogenesis and other skin immune diseases. These results indicate that PD-L1 fusion protein treatment significantly reverses/prevents depigmentation in Pmel-1 mice. These treatment effects were relatively stable but not permanent.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>PD-L1 fusion protein treatment significantly reduces pigment degradation in adult Pmel-1 mice.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining of paraffin-embedded section (4&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;m) was conducted according to standard methods. Immunohistochemical staining was performed following the regular procedure with the following antibodies: anti-CD3 (sc-20047), anti-CD4 (sc-7219) and anti-CD8 (sc-7188). Isotype controls (Santa Cruz) were included in each staining. Slides were examined using an Olympus microscope. Quantification of H&#x00026;E and IHC staining was performed by two experimenters for two sections of two mice per treatment group. Numbers of positive cells were counted for five high power fields (HPFs) and averaged. Immunofluorescent staining was performed following the regular procedure with the following antibodies: anti-CD3 (145-2C11), anti-CD4 (RM4-5), and anti-CD25 (PC61) antibodies (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p id="Par17">Cells were stained in flow cytometry staining buffer (00-4222-26, eBioscience) for 30&#x02009;minutes.
