Moreover, CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cell-mediated suppression contributes to infection susceptibility. We addressed the role of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells in tuberculosis pathogenesis, because this aspect has not been addressed during chronic infection. We targeted CCR4, which induces the influx of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells into the lungs. CCR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibited a lower frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells at 15, 30, and 70 days of infection than their wild-type counterparts. However, only at 70 days of infection was an exacerbated IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated immune response associated with apparent tuberculosis pathogenesis and susceptibility. In addition, CCR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibited a decrease in the suppressor function of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells. Adoptive transfer of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells into infected CCR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice restored pulmonary inflammation and bacterial load to levels observed in wild-type mice. Our findings suggest that CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells play a time-dependent role in tuberculosis and highlight that CCR4 plays a critical role in the balance of IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated inflammation by regulating the influx and function of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells.

These clinical and experimental findings show that inflammation, which is closely associated with protective immune responses, is a double-edged sword in tuberculosis pathogenesis and that IFN-&#x003b3; plays a critical role in this process. Approximately half of the patients who are cured with current tuberculosis drugs suffer tissue damage generated by excessive inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

Whereas CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells regulate inflammation-mediated tissue damage, this aspect has not been addressed during chronic tuberculosis, the hallmark of which is the perpetuation of lung inflammation. In a previous study, we showed that the suppressor function of regulatory T cells during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection is associated with the host genetic background and suggested that it could represent a susceptibility factor for tuberculosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Here, we show for the first time that regulatory T cells balance the effector function of Th1 cells in the chronic phase of infection and that this is critical to prevent exacerbation of pulmonary inflammation and, consequently, bacterial growth. Our findings suggest that tuberculosis pathogenesis results from a failure of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cell-mediated immune regulation. The absence of CCR4 causes an imbalance in lung CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells, which exacerbates the Th1-mediated immune response, induces excessive pulmonary inflammation and progression of infection.</p><p id="Par25">We confirmed that regulatory T-cells restrict the protective immune response in the early stage of experimental tuberculosis, as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The reduction in the accumulation of regulatory T cells at the beginning of the infection, as observed in CCR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice at 15 days post infection, could minimize the delay in the induction of the adaptive immune response, as has been previously described in tuberculosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Thus, CCR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are more resistant than their WT counterparts at 15 days post infection. At 30 days of infection, according to results obtained by our group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> animals generate a strong cellular immune response dependent on IFN-&#x003b3;. However, they are unable to control the infection. Therefore, a reduction in the influx of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells at 30 days of infection does not play an evident role in controlling pathogen replication or the lung inflammatory response. At 70 days of infection, lung CFU number declines in C57BL/6 mice, which are resistant to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, but not in CCR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Therefore, an imbalance in the frequency and number of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells, which is associated with the augmentation of Th1 effector cell function, has a deleterious effect on the magnitude of lung inflammation and, consequently, in the infection control.</p><p id="Par26">The identification of key molecules or receptors that can regulate the inflammatory response without affecting antimicrobial mechanisms is crucial for identifying new immunotherapy targets and for the design of host-directed therapies. We recently showed that an increase in CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells dependent on the IL-33/ST2 axis and induced by allergen exposure improves the resistance of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice. We found that M2 macrophages, a phenotype compatible with CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup> cells, in the presence of IFN-&#x003b3; exhibit strong mycobactericidal activity and provided insights into the balance of lung inflammation and the maintenance of antimicrobial mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">In addition to playing a role in the accumulation of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells in the lungs, CCR4 may also affect the function of these cells.

Chemokine receptors expressed by regulatory T cells affected their function in vivo by influencing their homing properties. A similar result has been observed in experimental allergic asthma, where the transfer of CCR4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells obtained from spleens and lymph nodes, but not CCR4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> regulatory T cells, attenuates eosinophilia, the production of IL-4 and IL-5, and airway inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The exacerbation of allergic inflammation was directly associated with impaired migration of CCR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> regulatory T cells to airways and augmented frequency of pulmonary Th2 cells. Therefore, regulatory T cells from CCR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are less suppressive, because the absence of CCR4 impairs the migration of these cells to the site of immune response. In addition, the absence of CCR4 impairs that regulatory T cells remain at the site of immune response and, consequently, make an effective contact with dendritic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

In vivo, we confirmed by the transfer of Foxp3-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells to infected CCR4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that during chronic infection, regulatory T cells contribute to the control of pathogen multiplication, possibly because they balance IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated inflammation.</p><p id="Par28">The reduction in the frequency, number and function of CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells is associated with an increased frequency of IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and increased IFN-&#x003b3; levels.

Although low-Th1 inflammation and a low capacity to produce IFN-&#x003b3; are the main causes of tuberculosis pathogenesis in young children and immunodeficient individuals, a high level of lung inflammation and an excessive IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> cell response are indicators of active disease in immunocompetent adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.
