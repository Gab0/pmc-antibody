These defects cannot be corrected by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and thymus transplantation has not yet been demonstrated to be fully curative. Here, we provide proof of principle of a novel approach toward thymic regeneration, involving the generation of thymic organoids obtained by seeding gene&#x02010;modified postnatal murine TECs into three&#x02010;dimensional (3D) collagen type I scaffolds mimicking the thymic ultrastructure. To this end, freshly isolated TECs were transduced with a lentiviral vector system, allowing for doxycycline&#x02010;induced Oct4 expression. Transient Oct4 expression promoted TECs expansion without drastically changing the cell lineage identity of adult TECs, which retain the expression of important molecules for thymus functionality such as Foxn1, Dll4, Dll1, and AIRE. Oct4&#x02010;expressing TECs (iOCT4 TEC) were able to grow into 3D collagen type I scaffolds both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that the collagen structure reproduced a 3D environment similar to the thymic extracellular matrix, perfectly recognized by TECs. In vivo results showed that thymic organoids transplanted subcutaneously in athymic nude mice were vascularized but failed to support thymopoiesis because of their limited in vivo persistence. These findings provide evidence that gene modification, in combination with the usage of 3D biomimetic scaffolds, may represent a novel approach allowing the use of postnatal TECs for thymic regeneration. <sc>stem cells translational medicine</sc>

</p><sec id="sct312526-sec-0003"><title>Introduction</title><p>The thymus is a primary lymphoid organ that represents a crucial component of the adaptive immune system, since the specialized thymic microenvironment sustains the development of a broad repertoire of self&#x02010;tolerant T lymphocytes <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>.

Therefore, thymic dysfunctions caused by physiological processes or by external stimuli render patients extremely vulnerable to infections, malignancies, and autoimmune diseases <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>.</p><p>Many research groups have primarily focused on finding possible strategies to rejuvenate the thymus and have developed promising therapeutic approaches to target unsuccessful thymopoiesis, post&#x02010;transplant immunodeficiency, and infection&#x02010;related morbidity and mortality after HSCT <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>. However, a few molecules and genes, such as keratin growth factor, Interleukin (IL)22, IL7, and Foxn1, have been identified as key players of the mechanistic pathway for endogenous thymic regeneration <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>. Growth factors and hormone therapies were also explored in order to restore age&#x02010;related or injury&#x02010;related thymic degeneration, but, despite encouraging results, they have short&#x02010;term effects and/or require a recurrent administration, which is complicated by their toxic effects on other tissues and organs <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>.</p><p>Thymus transplantation represents another promising alternative to complement bone marrow transplantation or to treat congenital thymic anomalies, but T&#x02010;cell reconstitution following thymus grafting is frequently incomplete and transient, complicated by a skewed T&#x02010;cell receptor repertoire and an increased occurrence of autoimmunity <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>.</p><p>The thymus is anatomically organized into two discrete cortical and medullary regions, containing phenotypically and functionally distinct thymic epithelial cells (TECs), named medullary TECs (mTECs) and cortical TECs (cTECs). The unique architecture of the thymic stroma is essential for TEC development and function as well as for the maturation and selection of a self&#x02010;tolerant T&#x02010;cell repertoire <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>. Differently from the epithelium of other organs, the thymic microenvironment is structured as a three&#x02010;dimensional (3D) network in which crosstalk of TECs and thymocytes takes place <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>.</p><p>The field of tissue engineering has put considerable efforts into the development of materials and techniques for the in vitro generation of tissues of clinical relevance <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>. The major challenge for tissue engineering is to successfully recreate the complexity of the 3D structure of the thymic microenvironment and to fully rebuild the composition and organization of the thymic extracellular matrix (ECM). The use of thymic organoids formed by human TECs and fibroblasts as well as seeding TECs into matrigel or other 3D biocompatible systems has been shown to promote a transient thymopoiesis in vivo <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>. The use of decellularized thymic tissue has been suggested to overcome these limitations and has shown promising results in mouse models <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>. However, the use of decellularized tissues, obtained from cadavers or patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery, limits the applicability of such approaches to the availability of donors.</p><p>The use of postnatal TECs for thymic regeneration has revealed challenging because of the loss of thymopoietic function of TECs after in vitro culture and their inability to reaggregate after isolation <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>. Recent studies have used several approaches that could overcome this barrier, including the identification of thymic epithelial progenitor cells (TEPCs) or the differentiation of embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells into TEPC, but they have all some limitations for clinical purposes <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>. To avoid the use of embryonic TECs or iPS&#x02010;derived TECs, attempts have been made by combining mature TECs with different 3D systems for developing functional mini&#x02010;thymus units <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>. Several studies have been focused on the investigation of ideal biomaterials for human applicability <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>, which need to be biocompatible, biodegradable, and easily detectable with imaging techniques regularly used in standard clinical practice. Collagen has been widely used in tissue engineering because it can be assembled in fibers closely reproducing the chemical and morphological characteristics of those present in soft tissues <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>. Therefore, the production of collagen porous biomatrix could make this biomaterial suitable for the generation of thymic constructs.</p><p>Hence, we developed a potentially new therapeutic strategy that foresees transplantation of biomimetic scaffolds, mimicking the thymic ECM organization, obtained by seeding adult murine TECs and expanding them into 3D collagen type I scaffolds. In order to use postnatal TECs for the generation of transplantable thymic structure, we sought to induce a short&#x02010;term expression of Oct4, a transcription factor involved in the maintenance or induction of pluripotency in embryonic cells <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>, to obtain transient partial de&#x02010;differentiation and promote their expansion. To create a physiologically relevant microenvironment to seed TECs, we tested 3D collagen type I scaffolds crosslinked with different amounts of 1,4&#x02010;butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDGE; 3%&#x02013;5%). Here, we show that 3% BDDGE collagen&#x02010;based scaffolds seeded with gene&#x02010;modified TECs and transplanted subcutaneously in athymic nude mice were perfused and colonized by small new blood vessels and were able to sustain TEC survival in a 3D microenvironment. However, further improvement of the 3D scaffold composition is required to obtain long&#x02010;term in vivo persistence of organoids that could allow the development of this approach for future clinical applications.</p></sec><sec id="sct312526-sec-0004"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sct312526-sec-0005"><title>Animals</title><p>Wild&#x02010;type (WT) C57BL/6 (B6) and CD1 athymic nude mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, Inc.

The crosslinking reaction was performed at 25&#x000b0;C and pH 5.5 to obtain a good compromise between molecular assembling and chemical crosslinking. In these conditions, BDDGE created bridges between collagen fibers improving the mechanical performance and decreasing the enzymatic degradation <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref>. By changing the crosslinker concentration and the fibers freeze&#x02010;drying technique, four different collagen&#x02010;based scaffolds were developed (Fig. <xref rid="sct312526-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). The scaffold Coll3_WC was synthetized without the cortical layer and showed a homogeneous porosity in the upper part, resembling the medullary region of the thymus. This morphology led to a highly open porous&#x02010;structure and consequently permitted a good perfusion of the scaffold when tested in dynamic conditions using the bioreactor. However, Coll3_WC did not completely recapitulate the thymic morphology, since it was lacking a cortical&#x02010;like region, and was, therefore, not further considered for in vitro and in vivo experiments. We further tested samples Coll3_1C and Coll5_1C, which contained both a collagen fibers organization similar to the medulla ECM and a denser pattern suggestive of the cortex. Both samples were characterized by high porosity as demonstrated by density and water squeezing methods (Fig. <xref rid="sct312526-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A) very similar to those observed for Coll3_WC. The higher crosslinking strength used for sample Coll5_1C induced the formation of a thicker cortical layer, precluding an efficacious perfusion of the scaffold. An additional collagen&#x02010;based scaffold was successfully developed (Coll3_2C) adding a second cortical layer while keeping the medulla like structure in the scaffold's center, which created an ultrastructure as in a native thymus. The presence of a double cortical layer slightly decreased the porosity of this type of scaffold and completely prevented its perfusion when the bioreactor perfusion&#x02010;test was performed. Therefore, Coll3_2C was not taken into consideration for further experiments. Figure <xref rid="sct312526-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B shows SEM images of a murine native thymus and of samples Coll3_1C and Coll5_1C. This comparison revealed their similar morphology to native thymic tissue indicating a good biomimicry of the selected scaffolds. Even though the higher amount of BDDGE (5%) led to an increase of thickness of the cortical layer in scaffold Coll5_1C, we considered both Coll3_1C and Coll5_1C appropriate for further experiments.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="sct312526-fig-0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Generation of collagen&#x02010;based scaffolds mimicking the thymic ultrastructure. <bold>(A):</bold> 3% and 5% 1,4&#x02010;butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDGE) collagen type I scaffolds with different structures were tested to check their porosity, density, and perfusion ability.

Inducible expression of Oct4 induced only a partial de&#x02010;differentiation of TECs, as proven by phenotypical comparison between iOCT4 TECs and UT TECs (Fig. <xref rid="sct312526-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). Indeed, Oct4 upmodulation led to an increase in the expression levels of precursor&#x02010;like markers (Thy1.2+/Sca1hi) <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">49</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">50</xref> and a more homogeneous expression of MHC II, an important molecule for TEC functionality. Of note, iOCT4 TECs maintained their epithelial phenotype, as shown by the expression of molecules associated with TECs differentiation (CD44) and with TECs specification (Epcam). Doxycycline washout from the culture reverted iOCT4 TEC phenotype, since 5 days after its removal (doxy without d5) iOCT4 TECs showed a phenotype similar to UT TECs (Fig. <xref rid="sct312526-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>D). RT&#x02010;PCR analyses demonstrated that Oct4 mRNA levels, relative to UT, were increased more than 100&#x02010;fold in iOCT4 TECs even after 1 passage in vitro and returned at basal levels upon doxycycline removal (Fig. <xref rid="sct312526-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E). Importantly, upmodulation of Oct4 in TECs strongly improved their in vitro expansion over time. Indeed, iOCT4 TECs showed a twofold increase in proliferation rate as compared with untransduced TECs, indicating that Oct4 is a good candidate for promoting in vitro expansion of postnatal TECs (Fig. <xref rid="sct312526-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>F).

We observed that 3% BDDGE scaffolds were better vascularized than 5% BDDGE scaffolds and this was evident both for UT and for iOCT4 TEC&#x02010;seeded structures (Fig. <xref rid="sct312526-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A).

Each transplanted scaffold was obtained by seeding TEC UT or transduced with PGK.GFP LV or with the Oct4&#x02010;inducible LV system. For these experiments, we used a bi&#x02010;directional regulator vector that stably expressed the Tet&#x02010;On trans&#x02010;activator protein (rtTA) and the firefly&#x02010;luciferase gene (Fig. <xref rid="sct312526-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A).

With these analyses, we confirmed the in vivo persistence of iOCT4 TECs inside the scaffold even though the fluorescence intensity and the number of live iOCT4 TECs were likely reduced 2 weeks after scaffold implantation. Interestingly, immunohistochemical analyses of tissue sections from grafted scaffolds seeded with either UT TECs or with iOCT4 TECs, exposed or not to doxycycline, demonstrated the presence of both cortical (CK8+ cells) and medullary (CK5+ cells) TECs in their inner part. The number of CK5+ and CK8+ cells was most prominent in iOCT4 TECs thymic scaffolds indicating that these cells were able to survive and proliferate better in vivo under the chosen conditions. Strikingly, in iOCT4 TEC&#x02010;seeded scaffolds, we detected the formation of small clusters formed by few mTECs (CK5+) and cTECs (CK8+), revealing that the 3D structure used in our experiments supports the compartmentalization and proliferation of mature TECs (Fig. <xref rid="sct312526-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C).</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="sct312526-fig-0004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>3% 1,4&#x02010;butanediol diglycidyl ether collagen type I scaffolds are more efficient for iOCT4 thymic epithelial cells (TECs) expansion after in vivo transplantation in athymic nude mice. <bold>(A):</bold> Images of transplanted animals were acquired by IVIS series preclinical in vivo system, 1 week (upper panel) or 2 weeks (lower panel) after scaffolds transplantation.

Indeed, collagen can be easily isolated from animal connective tissues and it has been widely used in tissue engineering, because it is biocompatible, biodegradable, and bioresorbable. It can be simply assembled in fibers closely reproducing the chemical, physical, and morphological characteristics of those present in soft tissues <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>. The 3D scaffolds that we developed have been formulated by modifying type I collagen matrix with different crosslinking approaches to reduce scaffold degradation rate when transplanted in vivo. The 3% BDDGE crosslinker concentration has been finally chosen over the 5% concentration as it conferred to the 3D scaffold a level of porosity, which is indispensable for its performance, which resembled the one typical native thymic ultrastructure. Indeed, scaffolds should have a well&#x02010;connected porous structure and a high porosity to ensure cellular penetration, nutrients diffusion, and waste products removal in order to decrease any interference between the scaffold and surrounding tissues <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">53</xref>. To this scope, we firstly analyzed the ultrastructure of a juvenile murine thymus and optimized the protocol for creating scaffolds that would be characterized by a porous part, similar to the thymic medulla, and a fibrous part recapitulating the thymic cortex. Particularly, the vertical and controlled freezing allowed the creation of an aligned highly porous structure at one side and a less porous but hardier surface at the other side of the scaffold (Coll3_1C) <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref>. As a consequence, Coll3_1C scaffolds seemed to be the most appropriate among all the scaffolds tested for the creation of thymic organoids, since they combined a well&#x02010;fitted morphology with a high porosity. Even though the pore size of Coll3_1C scaffolds was bigger than that of the native thymus, this attribute ensured a higher cell penetration and scaffold colonization. By using the 3% BDDGE 3D scaffolds, we could demonstrate that iOCT4 TECs were able to colonize them and to expand in vitro for up to 1 month, whereas untransduced TECs were lost in less than 2 weeks after seeding in the scaffolds. Hence, our approach that combined the use of collagen fibers with the development of a 3D structure met important structural characteristics of the native thymus and reproduced a 3D environment similar to the thymic ECM, perfectly recognized by TECs.</p><p>In vitro 3D models for the generation of T cells, made with fetal thymic cells (fetal thymic organoids cultures [FTOCs]) <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">54</xref>, demonstrated to partially support the generation of all T&#x02010;cell subsets. To avoid the use of fetal TECs, as a variant of FTOC, the RTOC (reaggregate thymic organ cultures [RTOCs]) <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">55</xref> were developed by using adult TECs or adult TEPCs but they failed to support HSC differentiation toward T&#x02010;cell lineages <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>. Indeed, adult TECs lose their ability to aggregate ex vivo and fail to maintain expression of important molecules, such as those of the Notch signaling pathway, when are not supported by a well&#x02010;organized 3D environment. Based on this insight, other researchers were able to successfully establish in vitro bone marrow derived cell lines (OP9&#x02010;DL1 or MS5&#x02010;Dll4 or MS5&#x02010;Dll1) or human thymic stromal cell lines (TEC&#x02010;Dl1) overexpressing the Notch ligand delta&#x02010;like 1 (Dll1) and Notch ligand delta&#x02010;like 4 (Dll4) <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">56</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">57</xref>. Even though these experimental systems were able to partially support thymocyte development in vitro, they could not recapitulate the complexity of the 3D thymic microenvironment and were not meant to create a functional approach for in vivo thymic regeneration. Our methodologies aimed at accomplishing all these requirements since it combined the use of 3D scaffolds, fully recapitulating the thymic microenvironment, with murine adult derived iOCT4 TECs. By an inducible upmodulation of Oct4 expression, we were able to promote mature TECs in vitro expansion without altering their functionality. Indeed, iOCT4 TECs maintained an epithelial phenotype, since they still expressed Epcam and CD44 after transduction, and most importantly, did not lose the expression of molecules such as Foxn1, AIRE, Dll1, Dll4, and MHC class II, proven to be fundamental for TEC functionality. However, a deeper expression profile analysis would be necessary in order to fully dissect the molecular mechanism by which Oct4 upmodulation acts in remodeling TEC expression profile and epigenome, since the role of Oct4 in promoting stem&#x02010;progenitor cells self&#x02010;renewal during embryogenesis or in inducing pluripotency in somatic cells is well known <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">58</xref>. Although this point needs further investigation, the induction of Oct4 in our approach is only transient and our results demonstrated that the transient expression of Oct4 did not drastically change the cell lineage identity of adult TECs, since their epithelial phenotype was preserved and most importantly they did not lose the expression of molecules and gene essential for TEC functionality. Additionally, when tetracycline was removed from the culture medium, iOCT4 TECs reacquired a phenotype very much resembling that of freshly isolated TECs, further confirming that our LV&#x02010;based system was able to control the expression of Oct4 without radically changing the nature of adult TECs. Importantly, Oct4 expression in adult TECs induced the expansion of a population of cells that presented an improved ability to support T&#x02010;cell differentiation in vivo, as compared with untransduced TEC or TEC transduced with the iOct4 LV system but not cultured with tetracycline, since thymic scaffolds generated with iOCT4 TEC supported a first wave of thymopoiesis 4 weeks after implantation in athymic nude mice. Indeed, in mice transplanted with 3D iOCT4 TEC structure, CD45+CD3+ cells were clearly visible already at 2 weeks after scaffold implantation and their frequency kept increasing over time, up to 10 weeks after transplant. Even though we detected some CD3+ cells in control groups, their frequency was significantly higher in animals transplanted iOCT4 TEC&#x02010;seeded scaffolds at the first time point analyzed (4 weeks). Significantly, in the PB of mice implanted with iOCT4 TEC&#x02010;seeded scaffolds, discrete populations of CD45+CD3+CD4+ and CD45+CD3+CD8+ cells were evident and improved over time. Of note, the frequency of T&#x02010;cell subsets in the PB of mice transplanted iOCT4 TEC&#x02010;seeded scaffolds was higher than that observed in other publications using similar approaches for thymus regeneration <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">59</xref>. In line with previous publications, we found that in all groups of animals, over 50% of circulating CD45+CD3+ cells did not express CD4 or CD8 and they are marked as double negative (DN) CD4&#x02212;CD8&#x02212; cells. A slight reduction in the frequency of DN T cells was detected in all transplanted animals <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">60</xref>, <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">61</xref>. We could not exclude that also in athymic nude mice a residual thymopoiesis may occur over time and this could explain the appearance of SP CD4+ and CD8+ cells also in the PB of mice that were not transplanted with scaffolds. Nonetheless, the increase of the DN and SP cell frequencies observed in these animals was not constant and did not keep increasing over time as conversely observed for mice implanted with iOCT4 TEC&#x02010;seeded scaffolds. Nevertheless, no major biological effects were achieved in animals transplanted with iOCT4 TEC&#x02010;seeded scaffolds and no amelioration of the nude phenotype was observed.</p><p>The strength of our system resides in the induction of Oct4 expression in TECs, which increases TEC proliferative ability and makes iOCT4 TECs functionally capable of growing in a 3D structure. We provide the first evidence that adult TECs can expand and survive in vitro. Further optimization of the experimental setting exploiting also novel recent biotechnological tools as well as the use of a biomimetic smart scaffold functionalized to decrease immune reactions need to be implemented for the future development of the protocol.</p><p>One of the most important features that our 3D thymic structure addressed was their ability to be vascularized in vivo after implantation. The presence of new blood vessel formation was already detectable 2 weeks after transplantation and most importantly more evident in those animals transplanted with scaffolds preseeded with iOCT4 TECs. Quantitative PE analyses of 3D thymic structure perfusion clearly demonstrated that iOCT4 TEC&#x02010;seeded scaffolds had a higher and continuous blood&#x02010;perfusion than those generated with untransduced TECs. Additionally, ex vivo immunocytochemistry analyses revealed a substantial number of CD31+ endothelial cells spread in iOCT4 TEC&#x02010;seeded scaffolds. These results indicate that 3% BDDGE collagen type I scaffolds could be easily perfused and colonized by endothelial cells and suggest a potential role of iOCT4 TECs in promoting de novo vascularization after in vivo implantation. Of note, small clusters of mTECs (cytokeratin 5+) and cTECs (cytokeratin 8+) were detectable in iOCT4 TEC&#x02010;seeded scaffolds starting from 2 weeks after in vivo transplantation. Notably, these cell agglomerates were not present or barely visible in transplanted scaffolds preseeded with cells different from iOCT4 TECs. Moreover, ultrasound and MRI studies performed on our 3D structures in vivo demonstrated the possibility to detect them with imaging techniques commonly applied in patients for soft tissues assessment. Both MRI and ultrasound allowed to easily distinguish the transplanted thymic structure from the surrounding soft tissue and to monitor their vascularization. Hence, MRI and US could represent useful radiological tools to monitor scaffolds engraftment in a potential future clinical application of our strategy.</p><p>Many studies have demonstrated that tissue engineered constructs failed to succeed because scaffolds were insufficiently porous, avoiding the formation of new blood vessels, or because they rapidly degraded after in vivo implantation <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">62</xref>. Despite achieving good porosity and observing new blood vessel formation in our 3D thymic&#x02010;like structures, we also noticed that iOCT4 TEC&#x02010;seeded thymic&#x02010;like organoids were rapidly degraded in vivo, impairing the growth of both iOCT4 TECs and endothelial cells, and consequently limiting their efficacy in sustaining thymopoiesis after implantation. A strong infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, detected 2 and 4 weeks after in vivo subcutaneous transplantation, could be the major cause of the rapid core degradation. Further improvement of scaffold formulation is necessary in order to increase their in vivo persistency and could be achieved by using different methods for the crosslinking of collagen fibers that could also potentially be more appropriate for future human medical application of the 3D scaffolds <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">63</xref>. Additionally, to improve the establishment of a functional and stable vascular perfusion inside the 3D structure, we are also considering functionalization of 3D scaffolds with angiogenic signals that would guarantee a local and sustained growth factor delivery ultimately leading to enhanced and sustained thymic organoids vascularization <xref rid="sct312526-bib-0064" ref-type="ref">64</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sct312526-sec-0025"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we provided proof of principle that collagen type I scaffolds possess important features that could be exploited and further implemented for thymic tissue engineering such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, and mechanical properties to ensure cell penetration and scaffold vascularization. Additionally, we showed that gene modification, mediated by Oct4 induction, allowed the use of postnatal TECs for the formation of 3D thymic&#x02010;like structures. The lack of functionality observed in immunodeficient mice after iOCT4 scaffolds transplantation could be due to the extensive colonization of the scaffold by innate immune cells of the host, in particular high number of neutrophils and macrophages. Scaffolds degradation was already visible and detectable 2 weeks after in vivo implantation, preventing any functional studies and most importantly impairing iOCT4 TEC organoids' ability to sustain de novo thymopoiesis. As a future perspective, to overcome the hurdles encountered, we might further implement the protocol by using higher numbers of TECs and exploiting alternative biomimetic and functionalized 3D scaffolds able to support long&#x02010;term in vivo persistence and thymopoietic activity of thymic organoids.</p></sec><sec id="sct312526-sec-0027"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>I.B.: conception and design, collection and/or assembly of data, data analyses and interpretation, manuscript writing, final approval of manuscript; M.S., E.C.: provision of study material, final approval of manuscript; E.D., E.F., G.E.M., F.F.: collection and/or assembly of data, final approval of manuscript; L.P., A.S., T.C.: collection and/or assembly of data, data analyses and interpretation, final approval of manuscript; M.C., A.E., A.L., L.N.: final approval of manuscript; T.D.T., L.S.S.: provision of study material; A.T.: financial support, final approval of manuscript; G.A.H., A.V.: conception and design, financial support, manuscript writing, final approval of manuscript; M.B.: conception and design, collection and/or assembly of data, data analyses and interpretation, financial support, manuscript writing, final approval of manuscript.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="sct312526-sec-0028"><title>Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors indicated no potential conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sct312526-supitem-0001"><caption><p>
