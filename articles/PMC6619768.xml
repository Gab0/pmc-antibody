Hence, the response of HCC to different cancer immunotherapies is being intensively investigated in clinical trials. Immune checkpoint blockers (ICB) show promising results, albeit for a minority of HCC patients. Mouse models are commonly used to evaluate new therapeutic agents or regimens. However, to make clinical translation more successful, better characterized preclinical models are required. We therefore extensively investigated two immune-competent orthotopic HCC mouse models, namely transplanted Hep-55.1c and transgenic iAST, with respect to morphological, immunological and genetic traits and evaluated both models&#x02019; responsiveness to immunotherapies. Hep-55.1c tumors were characterized by rich fibrous stroma, high mutational load and pronounced immune cell infiltrates, all of which are features of immune-responsive tumors. These characteristics were less distinct in iAST tumors, though these were highly vascularized. Cell depletion revealed that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from iAST mice do not affect tumor growth and are tumor tolerant. This corresponds to the failure of single and combined ICB targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4. In contrast, combining anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 showed significant antitumor efficacy in the Hep-55.1c mouse model. Collectively, our data comprehensively characterize two immune-competent HCC mouse models representing ICB responsive and refractory characteristics. Our characterization confirms these models to be suitable for preclinical investigation of novel cancer immunotherapy approaches that aim to either deepen preexisting immune responses or generate de novo immunity against the tumor.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was sponsored by Roche.

Viral infections (hepatitis B, hepatitis C), alcohol consumption and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases are the predominant risk factors [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. HCC development follows a multistep pathological process: different genetic alterations contributing to liver injury and chronic inflammation are followed by dysplastic transformation of hepatocytes [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219517.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Currently, patients diagnosed with HCC have a poor prognosis and usually receive palliative treatments [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219517.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, even the most powerful palliative drugs, such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sorafenib, approved for advanced HCC in 2007, and the recently approved TKI lenvatinib only show limited efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219517.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Immunotherapy is a promising alternative therapeutic strategy in HCC, and preclinical and clinical studies investigating immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) demonstrate better tumor shrinkage and improved overall survival [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219517.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The PD-1 and CTLA-4 signaling pathways represent the most common targets of current immunotherapies. The PD-1 pathway suppresses T cell activation and proliferation, and the CTLA-4 pathway is involved in T cell priming in the lymph node [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A recent clinical trial of nivolumab targeting PD-1 in HCC patients revealed a response rate of 20% and a manageable safety profile emphasizing the importance of ICB for successful HCC treatment [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In 2017, the FDA approved nivolumab as a second-line therapy for HCC patients, who did not respond to first-line sorafenib treatment [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In November 2018, a second anti-PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab, received approval for HCC patients, who have been previously treated with sorafenib [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Unfortunately, a significant portion of HCC still shows resistance to ICB [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, combination therapies are currently being explored in mice and humans and seem to be more potent than single agent administration [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Numerous mouse models have been developed to study human HCC and to investigate different therapeutic approaches [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Orthotopic models more closely resemble patient tumors than subcutaneous models because the tumors grow in their native environment. To induce orthotopic HCC, tumor cells can be injected directly into the liver [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219517.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or tumor fragments can be implanted intrahepatically [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219517.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Mouse models can be distinguished in either xenograft models using immune-deficient mice [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or syngeneic mouse models using immune-competent mouse strains such as C57BL/6. The latter are highly preferable for evaluating immunotherapies. In addition to syngeneic mouse models, humanized as well as genetically engineered models (GEM) can preclinically elucidate therapeutic immune responses against HCC [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Nevertheless, due to the multitude of etiological risk factors that underpin HCC recapitulate all descriptive features of the highly diverse HCC patient population.</p><p>In this study, we characterized the two different orthotopic HCC models, namely Hep-55.1c and iAST, [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] with respect to tumor growth, vascularization, morphology and immune infiltrate. Since mutational load is an important predictor of tumors&#x02019; susceptibility to immunotherapy we performed exome sequencing of the murine tumors to determine their mutational load and then compared them to human HCC. We also investigated the effect of two ICB targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4 in both models. The side by side evaluation highlights the most descriptive features and demonstrates that the established mouse models enable the investigation of novel HCC immunotherapies in tumors with either preexisting or lacking immunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Orthotopic implantation of Hep-55.1c tumor cells and fragments leads to successful HCC tumor growth in the liver</title><p>To generate an orthotopic HCC mouse model, Hep-55.1c tumor cells were inoculated into the left lateral liver lobe of immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219517.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, left).

In this context, we let tumors from both models grow to a comparable size, at which sufficient tissue for our analyses was available but no major necrotic areas had developed. More specifically, Hep-55.1c tumors were explanted after reaching a size of approximately 100 mm&#x000b3; (day 21 for Hep<sub>Cell</sub> mice and day 28 for Hep<sub>Frag</sub> mice). The iAST tumors were excised on day 56 upon virus injection as initial progression of this tumor is very slow compared to Hep tumors. H&#x00026;E staining identified different morphologies among the tumor models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219517.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). FAP staining of the intratumoral extracellular matrix revealed that Hep<sub>Cell</sub> tumors had a dense fibrotic network, which was even more pronounced in Hep<sub>Frag</sub> tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219517.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In contrast, iAST tumors were almost stroma-free.

Furthermore, iAST tumors were highly proliferative compared to Hep tumors as indicated by Ki67 stainings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219517.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In line with this, iAST tumors were characterized by higher tumor cell density.

In addition, iAST tumors&#x02019; blood vessels were more homogeneous distributed. Taken together, these results show that Hep tumors and iAST tumors are different in morphology, stroma content, vascularization and immune cell composition.

At the same time, cell inoculation into the liver lobe led to tumor cell dissemination into the lung. The formation of multiple lung tumors induced cachexia and severely reduced lifespan. The strong tumor dissemination and rapid growth makes this model rather artificial, and the short life span of animals limits the treatment window to assess drug responses. Furthermore, human HCC rarely form lung metastases [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Nonetheless, the Hep<sub>Cell</sub> model can also be used as preclinical lung metastasis model. The implantation of Hep-55.1c tumor fragments into the liver of C57BL/6 mice also caused progressive primary tumor growth but circumvented the random tumor cell seeding in the lung tissue and thus was considered preferable. In our opinion, the Hep<sub>Cell</sub> and Hep<sub>Frag</sub> models correspond to the less frequent situation of solitary HCC in patients whereby the Hep<sub>Frag</sub> model reflects HCC without any tumor cell seeding in the lung [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In contrast, the transgenic iAST model requires the application of the Cre recombinase to generate a multinodular HCC tumor growth in its natural environment. Compared to other GEM models, tumors of iAST mice grew rather quickly within 6&#x02013;7 weeks after virus injection, and have a tumor take rate of 100%. The adenovirus application induces the development of hepatitis followed by damage to liver parenchyma [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Yet iAST tumors&#x02019; aggressive development distinguishes them from human HCC, which typically progress slowly [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Histologically, the different tumor types reflect different HCC specific traits. Most human HCC are characterized by a strong intratumoral vascularization [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219517.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This feature was rather pronounced in iAST tumors in contrast to the lower vessel density in Hep<sub>Cell</sub> and Hep<sub>Frag</sub> tumors. Another typical feature of human HCC is that they frequently develop as a result of chronic liver damage and contain a high number of stroma cells [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Analysis of the extracellular matrix of mouse HCC tumors revealed that Hep-55.1c tumors have distinct stroma regions composed of fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM), whereas iAST tumors lack e.g. expression of FAP in the tumor microenvironment. As stroma regions are also present in subcutaneous Hep-55.1c tumors the development of the desmopastic framework might not be caused by surgical intervention. Tumor desmoplasia can affect immune cell infiltration and reasons for its development remain unclear [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. On the one hand, an early immune reaction may lead to scaring and thus a stroma-rich tumor. Alternatively, fibroblasts may be actively recruited by the tumor cells leading to enhanced ECM production to protect tumors from immune cell infiltration. Whichever hypothesis is correct, the lack of fibrous stroma in iAST tumors is a further indicator that this model is missing an immune reaction. In line with this, a richer immune infiltrate was found in Hep<sub>Frag</sub> tumors and Hep<sub>Cell</sub> tumors compared to iAST tumors. Published data indicate a correlation between intratumoral T and B cells correlate with a positive clinical outcome of HCC patients [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Strikingly, iAST tumors were found to be highly infiltrated by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, the key effector cells of most cancer immunotherapy approaches [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, the cell depletion experiment provided evidence that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in iAST mice did not affect tumor development. In inducible mouse models based on the Cre/loxP system the transgenic oncogene (SV40 T antigen) is presented as self antigen [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this context, Willimsky et al. have previously demonstrated that an incomplete function of the stop cassette leads to T cell tolerance towards the antigen before the onset of tumor development [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Mice with tolerant T cells did not induce functional cytotoxic T lymphocytes and were thus unable to reject the tumor. This characteristic of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells corresponds to cancer patients who are not responsive to cancer immunotherapy due to the presence of dysfunctional T cells in the tumor microenvironment [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219517.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In a variety of HCC patients, chronic inflammation and impaired co-stimulatory signals lead to T cell anergy or exhaustion [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Differences in the immune cell infiltrate can also be attributed to the genetic characteristics of HCC and are, therefore, major factors in the response to immunotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. HCC tumors consist of a heterogenic group of cells that can exhibit numerous mutations [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A typical genetic alteration detected in human HCC patients is found in the TP53 gene [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219517.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Here, sequencing the murine tumors revealed a variety of genetic alterations in Hep<sub>Cell</sub> and Hep<sub>Frag</sub> tumors including the common TP53 mutation. In contrast, iAST tumors show a low mutational burden, so that this model corresponds to human tumors with low numbers of genes carrying missense mutations and weak sensitivity to ICB [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>The preclinical evaluation of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 mono- and combination therapies revealed different responses of Hep<sub>Frag</sub> and iAST tumors. Combining both antibodies, anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4, led to tumor shrinkage in Hep<sub>Frag</sub> tumors, whereas the monotherapy had no beneficial effect on tumor regression. These data accord with previous studies indicating that anti-PD-1 monotherapy shows no therapeutic efficacy in Hep-55.1c tumor-bearing mice [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The superior outcome of dual checkpoint blockade has already been confirmed in clinical trials on different cancer types. In advanced melanoma the combination of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) resulted in a response rate of 53% and had a manageable safety profile similar to respective single antibody administrations [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219517.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This synergy and consequent enhanced anti-tumor responses are currently under investigation in a prospective Phase I/II study for advanced HCC (NCT01658878) [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The response to combined ICB targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4 may be explained by the mutational burden of Hep<sub>Frag</sub> tumors and the pre-existing immunity in this model. The initial immunogenic character of transplanted tumors was described recently [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Given the aforementioned fundamental differences in the composition of the tumor microenvironment of both HCC mouse models, the failure of single and combined ICB targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4 in iAST mice is not surprising and can be explained predominantly by the low number of missense genes and previously demonstrated T cell tolerance within the tumors. In addition, our data revealed very low PD-L1 expression in iAST tumors compared to Hep<sub>Frag</sub> tumors, which indicates that T cell inhibition is not dominantly mediated by PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. Different therapeutic strategies to overcome CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell tolerance and induce antitumor immunity are currently under investigation [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Cancer vaccines, CAR T cells and adoptive transfer of immune effector cells are promising approaches to provide tumor specific immune cells and mediate tumor regression [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Another effective option to treat HCC in immune-tolerant models is the TKI sorafenib, which has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and prolong survival of iAST mice [<xref rid="pone.0219517.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219517.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we here provide a comprehensive characterization of the orthotopic Hep-55.1c and of the iAST mouse models with regard to their suitability for preclinically testing new HCC treatment strategies, particularly cancer immunotherapies. We identified the Hep-55.1c model as responsive to combined ICB targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4. In contrast, the iAST model was shown to mirror ICB refractory characteristics, which renders the iAST model useful for testing cancer immunotherapy and combination treatments beyond ICB in order to overcome the HCC induced immune tolerance. In conclusion, increased knowledge of the fundamental characteristics of HCC mouse models is essential to correctly understand the mechanisms of cancer immunotherapies and thus, guide the treatment of HCC patients based on scientific rationale.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Mice and cell lines</title><p>Female mice (C57BL/6 wildtype or iAST transgenic mice) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany).
